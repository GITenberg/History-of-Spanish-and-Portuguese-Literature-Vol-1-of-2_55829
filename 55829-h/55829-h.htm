<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The growing interest of Spanish and Portuguese
Literature would, perhaps, be thought
a sufficient reason for laying the following
translation before the public, were the merits
of the original work even less conspicuous,
and the deficiency it appears fitted to
supply in our language less sensibly felt. It
is, indeed, extraordinary, that no similar work
has hitherto appeared in a country, where the
subject of which this history treats, has, in the
instances in which it has been partially explored,
always been found a rich source of
pleasure and instruction. But the information
thus collected from the literary stores of Spain
and Portugal, however satisfactory on particular
points, is, from its nature, detached and
incomplete, and seems calculated to increase
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
rather than to diminish the desire for such a
connected and comprehensive view of the
whole subject as M. Bouterwek has exhibited
in his General History of Modern Literature.</p>

<p>The following volumes on the literature of
Spain and Portugal are extracted from a work,
entitled, <i>Geschichte der Poesie und Beredsamkeit
seit dem Ende der dreizehnten Jahrhunderts</i>,
(History of Poetry and Eloquence from
the close of the thirteenth Century,) in which
M. Bouterwek has taken an historical and
critical survey of the literature of the principal
nations of Europe. The work consists of twelve
volumes, published at different periods at Göttingen;
the first volume having appeared in
1805, and the last, which contains an index to
the whole, in 1819.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The two volumes now
translated are the third and fourth of the
German original.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span></p>

<p>If it be admitted that there remains in
English literature a vacant place which ought
to be occupied by a work of this kind, it is
not apprehended that the means now resorted
to for filling up the chasm will be disapproved;
at least the translator is not aware that any
better source could have been found for supplying
the deficiency. In vain, she is persuaded,
would any substitute be sought for in
French, much as that language abounds in
works of criticism. Sismondi in his <i>Litterature
du Midi de l’Europe</i>, implicitly adopts
the judgments passed by Bouterwek on Spanish
and Portuguese literature; and indeed
with respect to that part of his subject he
says very little of importance that is not
directly borrowed from the German critic.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
The <i>Essai sur la Litterature Espagnole</i>, published
in Paris in 1810, and which appears
to have been well received by the French
public, is a gross plagiarism. It is, with some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
slight additions, merely the translation of an
anonymous English work, entitled, <i>Letters
from an English Traveller in Spain</i>, the
epistolary form being dropped, and the materials
transposed for the purpose of concealing
the theft.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The work of M. Bouterwek belongs,
however, to a superior class. To say that
M. Bouterwek has treated his subject with
great perspicuity and precision, would be to
express only a small portion of his merits. Extensive
and laborious as his enquiries have evidently
been, his judgment in the management
of his materials is still more remarkable than
the indefatigable research with which they
must have been obtained. He has not confined
himself to a mere narrative of the progress
and an exemplification of the beauties and
deformities of the literature of which he is
the historian.&mdash;The philosophic spirit which
pervades his criticism was not to be circumscribed
within such narrow bounds. He seeks
in the structure of society, the habits of the
people, and the influence of events, for the
causes of the intellectual phenomena he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
to describe; and he examines with great candour
and impartiality the effects of mis-government
and arbitrary institutions on poetic genius
and literary taste. Impressed with this favourable
opinion of the work, the translator has
endeavoured to give a true representation of
its contents. In undertaking the translation,
her wish was to preserve the character of
the original, as far as possible, under an
English dress. She began the task with an
anticipation of its difficulty, and she ends it
with a consciousness of the indulgence of
which her labours stand in need; but at the
same time with the hope that she will not be
found to have altogether failed in the object
she had in view.</p>

<p>The first of the following volumes is devoted
to the history of Spanish, and the second to the
history of Portuguese Literature. The subdivisions
of the work correspond with periods
marked out by certain revolutions in taste,
produced by the rise of eminent writers, or by
other influential circumstances. These epochs
in literary cultivation form convenient resting
places for the student, and contribute to
exhibit in a clear point of view the circumstances
by which the advancement of
polite learning has been accelerated or retarded.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
The specimens, which are numerous,
and a great portion of which are selected
from very scarce works, cannot fail to prove
highly acceptable to the lovers of the literature
of Spain and Portugal. For a general
and comprehensive knowledge of that literature
they will be found amply sufficient,
and to those who wish to pursue its study more
in detail, they will afford most useful assistance.
In such a course of study, great advantage may
also be derived from the numerous bibliographical
notes which the author has introduced,
and which are therefore scrupulously retained
in the translation.</p>

<p>The translator at first intended to give literal
versions of all the specimens extracted from
Spanish and Portuguese authors; but had she
persisted in this plan, the translation could not
have been completed without augmenting the
price of the publication much beyond the rate
to which the publishers were of opinion it
ought to be limited. To have omitted a part
of the extracts in order to give translations of
the rest would have been still more improper,
for the extracts quoted in the notes are all
necessary to the illustration of the text; and
besides such a mutilation would have deprived
the work of a merit which has just been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
pointed out, namely, that of supplying sufficient
materials for a comprehensive study
of the literature of Spain and Portugal. The
translator has it, however, in contemplation, to
prepare for the press a volume containing
translations of the specimens given by M.
Bouterwek, and of some other pieces from
the Spanish and Portuguese languages. This
volume will not form a mere appendix to the
volumes now published; an endeavour will
be made to render it useful and entertaining as
a separate work.</p>

<p>It is necessary to observe, that the History
of Italian Literature, which is sometimes referred
to in the notes, is a part of M.
Bouterwek’s General History of Poetry and
Eloquence. It forms the two first volumes of
the German work; some other parts of which
the translator will be prepared to send to
the press, should the merits of the original
procure from the public a favourable reception
for these volumes on Spanish and Portuguese
Literature.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the translator had
considerable assistance in reading and revising
the proofs, she regrets to find that still further
correction would have been desirable. Fortunately,
however, there are few errors in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
Spanish and Portuguese extracts; and those
which do occur in the English text, will be
found to be in general of a literal or obvious
nature, altogether incapable of misleading the
intelligent reader. Of the mistakes of the press
which have been observed, tables of errata are
made. If there are others, the translator is
confident, that the persons who are the best
able to correct such faults, will be the most
ready to pardon them.

<span class="large hang" id="GENERAL_VIEW_OF_THE_ORIGIN_OF_ROMANTIC">GENERAL VIEW OF THE ORIGIN OF ROMANTIC
POETRY AND ELOQUENCE, IN THE KINGDOMS
OF SPAIN AND PORTUGAL.</span></h2>

<p id="Recollection_of_the_general">When modern refinement began, during the
thirteenth century, to emerge from the rudeness
of the middle ages, that part of Europe
which geographers have called the Pyrenean
Peninsula, and which, according to its present
political division, forms Spain and Portugal,
contained four Christian kingdoms and some
Mahometan principalities, to which the title
of kingdom has also been given. More than
five hundred years had elapsed since the
battle of Xerez de la Frontera;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and the
Moors, who, by the result of that conflict,
obtained the dominion of the greater part of
Spain and Portugal, had, by the repeated
victories of the Christians, been, in their turn,
driven back to the southern extremity of the
country, and were obviously not destined to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
maintain themselves much longer even in that
quarter.</p>

<p>During these five centuries of almost uninterrupted
warfare between the race of Moorish
Arabs and the Christians of ancient European
descent, both parties, notwithstanding that
their reciprocal hostility was influenced by
fanaticism, had unconsciously approximated
in mind and in manners. The intervals of
repose, which formed short links in the chain
of their sanguinary conflicts, afforded them
some opportunities for the interchange of the
arts of peace, and they were soon taught to
feel for each other that involuntary respect
which the brave can never withhold from
brave adversaries. Love adventures, in which
the Moorish knight and Christian lady, or
the Christian knight and Moorish lady, respectively
participated, could not be of rare
occurrence. The Arab, who, in his native
deserts, had not been accustomed to impose
on women half the despotic restraints to
which the sex is subject in the harems of
Mahometan cities, was soon disposed to imitate
the gallantry of the descendants of the
Goths; and still more readily did the imagination
of the Christian knight, in a climate
which was far from being ungenial, even to
African invaders, acquire an oriental loftiness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Thus arose the spirit of Spanish knighthood,
which was, in reality, only a particular form
of the general chivalrous spirit then prevailing
in most of the countries of Europe,
but which, under that form, impressed in an
equal degree, on the old European Spaniard
an oriental, and on the Spanish Moor a
European character.</p>

<p>In the first period of this long contest
the Arabs carried learning and the arts to a
degree of cultivation far beyond any thing
known in the Christian parts of Spain. Those
wild enthusiasts learned, on the European
soil, to estimate the value of civilized life
with a rapidity as astonishing as that which
distinguished the social improvement of their
brethren, whom they had left behind in
Asia, under the government of the Caliphs.
Before the era of Mahomet, their language
had been cultivated and adapted
to poetry and eloquence, according to the
laws of oriental taste. In Spain, it soon
acquired, even among the conquered Christians,
the superiority over the barbarous
<i>Romance</i>, or dialect of the country, which
was then governed by no rule: for in the
eighth century, when the Moors penetrated
into Spain, the Visigoths, who had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
masters of the territory since the fifth century,
were not yet completely intermixed by
matrimonial alliances with the <i>Provincials</i>,
or descendants of the Roman subjects; and
the new national language, which had grown
out of a corrupt latin, was still the sport of
accident. The conquered Christians, in the
provinces under Moorish dominion, soon forgot
their Romance. They became, indeed,
so habituated to the Arabic, that, according
to the testimony of a bishop of Cordova,
who lived in the ninth century, out of
a thousand Spanish Christians, scarcely one
was to be found capable of repeating the
latin forms of prayer, while many could express
themselves in Arabic with rhetorical
elegance, and compose Arabic verses.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>But the Christians who had preserved their
independence, descending from the mountains
of the Asturias, began to repel the invaders,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
and in proportion as they extended their
conquests, a wider field was opened for the
Spanish tongue. It remained, nevertheless,
long barren and rude, and was destined to
receive many additions from the rich and elegant
Arabic, before it attained the copiousness
requisite for the wants even of common life.</p>

<p id="View_of_the_principal_idioms">The circumstances, however, under which
the dialects of the several provinces existed,
did not present those facilities for an improved
national language, on the principle of the
Italian <i>Volgare illustre</i>, of the age of Dante,
which would have enabled a poet of Dante’s
genius, had such then arisen in Spain, to form
out of them one general literary language for
all the Christian states of the Peninsula. It
happened, singularly enough, that about the
beginning of the thirteenth century, the three
principal idioms which were spoken from the
coast of the Atlantic to the Pyrenees, and
from the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterranean,
were represented by three kingdoms perfectly
independent of each other. The Castilian
prevailed exclusively only in the Castiles and
Leon, the latter of which was permanently
united to the former in the year 1230. The
Portuguese was spoken both by the court and
the people of Portugal. In the kingdom of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Arragon, the language in general use was the
Catalonian, a dialect nearly the same as the
Provençal or Limosin of the south of France,
but differing greatly both from the Castilian
and the Portuguese. This language also extended
to the little kingdom of Navarre, but
it was there spoken only by the nobles, who
were of French or Hispano-Gothic origin.
The great body of the population in Navarre
spoke the ancient Cantabrian, called <span class="smcap">Baskian</span>,
<span class="smcap">Vaskian</span>, or <span class="smcap">Biscayan</span>, and which still exists
in the Pyrenees and in the Spanish province
of Biscay.</p>

<p>The trouble will be repaid if a glance be
now cast on the map, in order to distinguish,
with somewhat more precision than is usually
thought necessary, the respective domains of
the three principal dialects of the Spanish
tongue; for it would be very difficult, if not
impossible, to form any opinion on the contest
maintained between the Spaniards and the
Portuguese relative to the value of their
respective languages, and the influence which
the merits or demerits of these languages have
had on the polite literature of both countries,
without a knowledge of the geographical
boundaries, which, previously to the political
divisions, separated the Portuguese from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Castilians, and the latter from the Arragonese.
In these questions the Biscayan language is
of no consideration, as it has only an accidental
and unimportant connexion with the
other Spanish dialects, and, besides, bears not
the most remote resemblance to them.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>The mutilated latin spoken along the
Mediterranean on the Spanish shore, from
the Pyrenees as far as Murcia, appears to
have resolved itself, before the period of the
Arabian invasion, into the same language
which extended eastward from the Pyrenees
through the whole of the south of France to
the Italian frontiers, and which, according to
the most remarkable of its provincial forms,
was called the <span class="smcap">Catalonian</span>, the <span class="smcap">Valencian</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Limosin</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Provençal</span>. Of all
the tongues spoken in modern Europe, this
language of the coasts was the first cultivated.
In it the Troubadours sang, and their
lays had all the same character, whether
addressed to the Italians, the French, or the
Spaniards. From Catalonia it probably spread
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
itself along the chain of the Pyrenees. The
kingdom of Arragon became, after the restoration
of the Spanish romance in that quarter,
its second country; for there both it and the
poetry of the Troubadours were particularly
favoured by the princes and the nobles. But
at the very period of the decline of this
poetry, the kingdom of Arragon was united
to the Castilian dominions. Another kind
of poetry, in the Castilian language, then
obtained encouragement, and the seat of the
government of the united kingdoms was permanently
fixed in Castile. The energetic
development of literary talent among the
Castilians, the bold romantic character of that
people, and that ardent spirit of national pride
which prompted them to make the most of all
their advantages, soon banished the ancient
and in other respects highly esteemed dialect
of Arragon, Catalonia, Valencia, and Murcia,
from literature, law, and the conversation of
the superior classes of society. Finally,
towards the middle of the sixteenth century
the Castilian became, in the strictest sense of
the word, the reigning language of the whole
Spanish monarchy.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>The Castilian tongue (<i>Lengua Castellana</i>),
now called, by way of distinction, the Spanish,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
doubtless had its origin before the Moorish
conquest, in the northern and midland parts
of the Peninsula. How far it had originally
spread towards the south, it would not now be
easy to determine; but it came down from the
Asturian mountains with the warriors who
boldly undertook to recover the country of
their fathers. It first resumed its sway in the
kingdoms of Leon and old Castile, where it
is still spoken in the greatest purity.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> It
then followed step by step, the fortune of the
Castilian arms, until it finally became the
established language of the most southern
provinces, where its progress had been longest
withstood by the Arabic. More recently
cultivated than the Catalonian, it cannot be
doubted that it owes to that dialect a part of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
its improvement; but the elevated expression
of its long full-toned words, soon stamped on
it the character of quite a different kind of
romance. The abbreviation of the latin words
which gave the Catalonian language a striking
resemblance to the French, was not agreeable
to the genius of the Castilian, which, in consequence
of its clear sonorous vowels and the
beautiful articulation of its syllables, had, of
all the idioms of the Peninsula, the greatest
affinity to the Italian. Amidst the euphony
of the Castilian syllables, the ear is however
struck with the sound of the German and
Arabic guttural, which is rejected by all the
other nations that speak languages in which
the latin predominates.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>The romance, out of which the present
Portuguese language has grown, was probably
spoken along the coast of the Atlantic
long before a kingdom of Portugal was
founded. Though far more nearly allied to
the Castilian dialect than to the Catalonian,
it resembles the latter in the remarkable
abbreviation of words, both in the grammatical
structure and in the pronunciation. At
the same time it is strikingly distinguished
from the Castilian by the total rejection of the
guttural, by the great abundance of its hissing
sounds, and by a nasal pronunciation common
to no people in Europe except the French
and the Portuguese. In the Spanish province
of Galicia, only politically separated from
Portugal, this dialect known under the name
of <i>Lingoa Gallega</i> is still as indigenous as in
Portugal itself, and was at an early period, so
highly esteemed, that Alphonso X. king of
Castile, surnamed the Wise, (<i>El Sabio</i>,)
composed verses in it. But the Galician
modification of this dialect of the western
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
shores of the Peninsula has sunk, like the
Catalonian romance of the opposite coast,
into a mere provincial idiom, in consequence
of the language of the Castilian court being
adopted by the higher classes in Galicia.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
Indeed the Portuguese language, which in
its present state of improvement must no
longer be confounded with the popular idiom
of Galicia, would have experienced great
difficulty in obtaining a literary cultivation,
had not Portugal, which, even in the twelfth
century, formed an independent kingdom,
constantly vied in arts and in arms with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Castile, and during the sixty years of her
union with Spain, from 1580 to 1640, zealously
maintained her particular national character.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p id="Original_separation_of">After accurately distinguishing these three
principal idioms of the Romance, which formed
the early spoken and written language of the
Peninsula,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> it will be more readily perceived
why the Catalonian and Limosin poetry could
not maintain itself in competition with the
Spanish and Portuguese, which were of more
recent growth, and why the poetry of Spain
and that of Portugal have, from their first
rise, preserved nearly the same character and
passed through the same periods of splendour
and decay. The Catalonian poetry was, from
its origin, inseparably united with the language
of the Troubadours, throughout its territories,
from the Italian to the Castilian frontiers.
While the <i>Cours d’Amour</i>, the festal meetings,
and various other gallant exhibitions
prevailed, in which the <span class="smcap">Gaya Ciencia</span>, or
Joyous Art, of these bards of love and chivalry
flourished, and in which the bards themselves
bore a brilliant part as masters of the ceremonies,
the language and the poetry gave
reciprocal importance to each other. When,
however, the romantic spirit had exhausted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
itself in these modes, when another sort of
gallantry came into vogue, and finally, when
a more cultivated style of poetry, entirely new
to Spain, was introduced from Italy, and propagated
with the Castilian language, the
poets of Catalonia, Arragon, and Valencia
began to write verses in the new manner, and
to disown their mother tongue in their compositions.
This literary phenomenon, which
has its epoch only in the sixteenth century,
cannot be attributed to political dependence
alone; for hitherto the ancient national poetry
of the Castilians had continued foreign to
the inhabitants of the Arragonian provinces,
individual imitators excepted, even after these
provinces were united with the Castiles. But
when the Arragonese, in their zeal to vie with
the Castilians in the reform of their ancient
poetry, began to write verses in the Castilian
language, their success was facilitated by the
relationship which had long subsisted between
the old Provençal poetry, the sister of the
Limosin, and the Italian, which in the
sixteenth century became the model of the
Spanish and Portuguese.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>The ancient Castilian poetry was as closely
allied to the Portuguese and the Galician, as
it was distinctly separated from the Limosin.
The Troubadours had, it is true, chaunted
their lays at the courts of Castile and Portugal,
but the national taste in both kingdoms
preferred different accents, other metrical
combinations, and was accustomed to quite
another kind of poetry of its own creation.
No Troubadours were needed in these countries;
for the common national poetry, which was
unknown to the Arragonian provinces, formed
a connecting tie for the Castilians, Portuguese,
and Galicians, as it was the faithful mirror of
their genius and character. However much
the Castilians might dislike the Portuguese
tongue, and the Portuguese, in their turn, the
Castilian, their poetry continued essentially
the same; and the languages of both countries
deviated, at all times, far more from the
Limosin romance, than ever they differed from
each other. Besides, the old Galician idiom,
which was scarcely distinguishable from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
old Portuguese,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> was originally a favourite
with the Castilians; and when it ceased to be
a literary language, the political conflicts of
the Spaniards and the Portuguese did not
destroy the poetical harmony of the two
nations. The Castilians, indeed, constantly
maintained the opinion, that the Portuguese
language was incapable of giving appropriate
expression to heroic sentiments; but the Portuguese
contradicted this assertion, not merely
by words, but by deeds.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>The old Castilian, Portuguese, and Galician
poetry was, under its own peculiar forms, still
more popular and strictly national than was
the Provençal, or than the Italian after it
has ever been. It was not destined to be
recited in courtly circles, before lords and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
ladies. It arose amidst the clang of arms,
and was fostered by constantly reiterated relations
of warlike feats and love adventures,
transmitted from mouth to mouth; while almost
every one who either witnessed or participated
in those feats and adventures, wished to give
them traditional circulation in the vehicle of
easy verse. So common was the practice
among all ranks of composing verses, particularly
in Portugal, that the historian, Manuel
de Faria y Sousa, thought himself, at a later
period, justified in calling every mountain in
that country a Parnassus, and every fountain
a Hippocrene.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> The poems called Romances
took their name from the national language;
and it is probable that the same name was at
first given to all kinds of amatory and heroic
ballads, the taste for which, however rapidly
those productions increased and supplanted
each other, appears to have been insatiable.
To mark with critical precision the limits of
the different species of poetic composition,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
was never contemplated by the authors of
the Romances, but they very carefully distinguished,
in their national verse, several
kinds of measure and forms of rhyme, which
differed widely from the Provençal and
Limosin; and having touched on this subject,
it will, perhaps, be most convenient here to
introduce a brief description of the nature of
the verse common to the ancient Castilian,
Portuguese, and Galician poetry.</p>

<p id="National_metres_and_rhymes">Of the metrical compositions common to
the ancient Castilians and Portuguese, the
most peculiarly national were the <small>REDONDILLAS</small>.
All verses, consisting of four trochaic
feet, appear to have been originally comprehended
under the name of <i>redondillas</i>,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
which, however, came at length to be, in
preference, usually applied to one particular
species of this description of verse. To a
people so romantic and chivalrous, and at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
same time so fond of their national poetry,
as the Spaniards and Portuguese, nothing
could be more agreeable than verses of this
sort, which, in languages such as theirs,
could be composed on the spur of the occasion,
and which to the charm of simplicity
add the beauty of a sonorous harmony.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> It
is difficult to suppose that the redondillas
have been formed in imitation of bisected
hexameters, as some Spanish authors have
imagined.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> They may, with more probability,
be considered a relic of the songs of
the Roman soldiers, which were doubtless
often heard in these countries, and which
must have left recollections, the impressions
of which would be easily communicated by
the romanized natives to their conquerors,
the Visigoths.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> In such verses, every individual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
could, without restraint, pour forth
the feelings which love and gallantry dictated,
accompanied by his guitar; as little attention
was paid to correctness in the distinction
of long and short syllables as in the rhyme.
When one of the poetic narratives, distinguished
by the name of Romances, was sung,
line followed line without constraint, the
expression flowing with careless freedom, as
feeling gave it birth. When, however, romantic
sentiments were to be clothed in a
popular lyric dress, to exhibit the playful
turns of the ideas under still more pleasing
forms, it was found advantageous to introduce
divisions and periods, which gave rise to regular
strophes (<i>estancias</i> and <i>coplas</i>). Lines
were, for the sake of variety, shortened by
halving them; and thus the tender and impressive
melody of the rhythm was sometimes
considerably heightened. Seduced by
the example of the Arabs, something excellent
was supposed to be accomplished when a
single sonorous and unvarying rhyme was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
rendered prominent throughout all the verses
of a long romance.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Through other romances,
however, pairs of rhymeless verses
were allowed to glide amidst a variety of
rhymed ones. At length, at a later period,
it was observed, that in point of elegance,
the <i>redondilla</i> was improved, rather than
injured by the change which was produced;
when, instead of perfect rhymes, imperfect
ones, or sounds echoing vowels but not consonants,
were heard in the terminating syllables.
Hence arose the distinction between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
<i>consonant</i> and <i>assonant</i> verses, which has
been cultivated into a rhythmical beauty unknown
to other nations.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Thus varied, and
yet ever simple, the redondilla has been still
more valuable to Spanish and Portuguese
versification, than the hexameter was to the
poetry of Greece and Rome. It has even
become the prevailing measure of dramatic
poetry.</p>

<p>The period of the invention of the redondillas
was also nearly that of the dactylic
stanzas, called <i>versos de arte mayor</i>, because
their composition was considered an art of
a superior order. They had their origin,
according to some authorities, in Galicia
and Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> This metrical form is, however,
found in several of the most ancient
Castilian poems. As the inventors of these
stanzas were ignorant of the true principles
of prosody, the attention paid to purity in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
the rhythm of the dactyles was even less than
in the rhymes of the redondillas. They
contented themselves with dealing out eleven
or twelve syllables, and left the dactylic measure
to accident. This may account for these
verses falling into disuse, as the progressive
improvement of taste, which allowed the
redondillas to maintain their original consideration,
was not reconcilable with the half
dancing, half hobbling rhymed lines of the
<i>versos de arte mayor</i>.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Besides the above national modes of
rhythm and rhyme, common to Castilians,
Galicians, and Portuguese, the form of the
sonnet was also known in the west of Spain
and Portugal long before the imitation of
Italian poetry was thought of in those parts
of the Peninsula. It had doubtless been
acquired through the intervention of Provençal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
and Limosin poets. But the character
of the sonnet was not sufficiently popular for
the old Spaniards and Portuguese, and they
were never fond of that kind of poetic composition.
Not less adverse to the taste of
the country was the long protracted alexandrine.
Monkish rhymesters, who forced their
imitations of latin doggrels on the nation,
introduced this kind of verse into the Spanish
language, in the thirteenth or perhaps even
in the twelfth century, but certainly at a
period anterior to its appearance in any other
modern tongue. It soon, however, sunk into
disesteem, and was neglected.</p>

<p>Thus, during the progress of their civilization,
the Spaniards and the Portuguese co-operated
in cultivating the same spirit and
form of poetry. What is, notwithstanding,
dissimilar in the polite literature of the two
countries, and what is peculiar to each, will,
with other subjects, become matter for consideration
in the following sheets.

<h3 id="PROBABLE_PERIOD_OF_THE_FIRST_ROMANCES">PROBABLE PERIOD OF THE FIRST ROMANCES.</h3>

<p>The origin of Castilian poetry is lost in the obscurity
of the middle ages. The poetic spirit which then
awoke in the north of Spain, doubtless first manifested
itself in romances and popular songs. <i>Rodrigo
Diaz de Vivar</i>, called <i>El Campeador</i>, (the Champion),
and still better known by the Arabic title of the
<i>Cid</i>, (the Lord or Leader), assisted in founding the
kingdom of Castile for his prince, Ferdinand I. about
the year 1036, and the name and the exploits of that
favorite hero of the nation were probably celebrated
during his own age in imperfect redondillas. That
some of the many romances which record anecdotes of
the life of the Cid may be the offspring of that period, is
a conjecture which, to say the least of it, has never been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
disproved; and indeed the whole character impressed
upon Spanish poetry from its rise, denotes that the era
which gave birth to the first songs of chivalry must be
very remote. In the form, however, in which these
romances now exist, it does not appear that even the
oldest can be referred to the twelfth, far less to the
eleventh century.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<h3 id="POEMA_DEL_CID">POEMA DEL CID.</h3>

<p>Some examples of Old Castilian verse, which are
held to be more ancient than any known romance
or ballad in that language, have been preserved.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
Of these the rhymed chronicle, Of the Exile and
Return of the Cid, (<i>Poema del Cid, el Campeador</i>),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
is considered the oldest. This chronicle can scarcely
be called a poem; and that it could not have been
the result of a poetic essay made in the spirit of
the national taste, is evident, from the nature of the
verse, which is a kind of rude alexandrine. It is the
more difficult to speak with any certainty respecting its
age, as there also exists a very old prose account of the
Cid, which corresponds in all the principal facts with
this rhymed chronicle. Though it may be true that
the author lived about the middle of the twelfth century,
as his editor Sanchez supposes, still it is not with
this work that the history of Spanish poetry ought to
commence. As a philological curiosity, the rhymed
chronicle is highly valuable; but any thing like poetry
which it contains must be considered as a consequence
of the poetic character of the nation to which the versifier
belonged, and of the internal interest of the subject.
The events are narrated in the order in which
they succeed each other, and the whole work scarcely
exhibits a single mark of invention. The small portion
of poetical colouring with which the dryness of the
relation is occasionally relieved, is the result of the chivalrous
cordiality of the writer’s tone, and of a few
happy traits in the description of some of the situations.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<h3 id="POEMA_DE_ALEXANDRO_MAGNO">POEMA DE ALEXANDRO MAGNO.</h3>

<p>Still less of the character of poetry belongs to the
fabulous chronicle of Alexander the Great (<i>Poema de
Alexandro Magno</i>), respecting the origin and age of
which the Spanish critics are far from being agreed.
Whether it be, as some pretend, a Spanish original of
the twelfth or thirteenth century, or as others assert,
the translation of a French work of the same age, in
verse, or, what is still more probable, a versified translation
of a latin legend, with the manufacture of which
some monk had occupied his solitary hours, are questions
which a writer of the history of Spanish poetry
cannot, with propriety, stop to discuss, even though
alexandrine verse should, as some suppose, have taken
its name from this chronicle. Next to stringing together
his rhymes,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> the chief object of the author probably was
to dress the biography of Alexander the Great in the
costume of chivalry. Accordingly he relates how the
<i>Infante</i> Alexander, whose birth was distinguished by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
numerous prodigies, seemed, while yet a youth a
Hercules; how he was taught to read in his seventh
year; how he then every day learned a lesson in the
seven liberal arts, and maintained a daily disputation
thereon; and many other wonders of this sort.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Alexander’s
officers are counts and barons. The real history
only feebly glimmers through a grotesque compound of
puerile fictions and distorted facts. But perhaps this
mode of treating the materials is not to be laid to the
account of the versifier.</p>

<h3 id="GONZALO_BERCEO">GONZALO BERCEO.</h3>

<p>There are some prayers, monastic rules, and legends
in Castilian alexandrines, which are regarded as of very
ancient date, but they were probably composed by
Gonzalo Berceo, a benedictine, about the middle of
the thirteenth century. Spanish authors have made
the dates of the birth and death of this monk objects
of very minute research, and have exerted great industry
in recovering his rude verses.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> In this field,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
however, the poetical historian can find nothing worth
the gleaning.</p>

<h3 id="ALPHONSO_X"><span class="smcap">ALPHONSO X.; HIS LITERARY MERITS&mdash;NICOLAS
AND ANTONIO DE LOS ROMANCES</span>, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>The names of several early writers of rude Castilian
verse are recorded by different authors. A notice,
however, of the literary merits of Alphonso X. called
the <i>Wise</i>, by which is meant the learned, forms the
most suitable commencement for a history of Spanish
poetry. This sovereign, who was a very extraordinary
man, for the age in which he lived, was ambitious,
among his other distinctions, of being a poet.
Scarcely any romance or song of true poetic feeling can
be attributed to him; but he loved to embody his science
and learning in verse. He disclosed his Alchymical
Secrets in the dactylic stanzas, called <i>versos de arte
mayor</i>. Alchymy was his favourite study; and if his
assertions in verse may be relied on, he several times
made gold, and in times of difficulty turned his power
of producing that precious metal to his own advantage.
His verses are, in some degree, harmonious, and ingeniously
constructed; but no trait of poetic description
enlivens the dry and uninteresting precepts he details.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
It is not, therefore, on account of his rhymes that
Alphonso the Wise deserves to be placed at the head of
the Castilian poets. His claim to occupy that station
can only be founded on the attention he devoted to
the cultivation of the Castilian language, an attention
which is easily recognized even in his unpoetic verses,
and which could not fail to prove a most powerful
incitement to emulation, since he who set the example
was the king of the country, and possessed a reputation
for learning which was flattering to the national pride.
The greater purity and precision which was thus introduced
into the dialect of Castile and Leon, enabled the
poetic genius of the nation to unfold itself with increasing
vigour and freedom. But the benefits which
Alphonso conferred on the Spanish language and literature,
did not stop here. The bible was, by his command,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
rendered into Castilian; and a Paraphrase of
Scripture History accompanied the translation. A
General Chronicle of Spain, and a History of the
Conquest of the Holy Land, founded on the work of
William of Tyre, were also written by his order.
Finally, he introduced the use of the national language
into legal and judicial proceedings. No direct interest
was, however, taken by Alphonso in the improvement
of the popular Castilian poetry. He probably thought
it too destitute of art and learning to deserve much
consideration. It appears to have been on this account,
and not from vanity, that he favoured the Troubadours,
assembled at his court, in whose more elegant verse his
praises were unceasingly proclaimed.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> His influence
had an extensive operation; but his death, which happened
in the year 1284, was no loss to the national
bards of Castile, who still sung their Romances in
obscurity.</p>

<p>The history of Spanish poetry continues barren of
names until towards the end of the fourteenth century;
and yet, according to all literary probability, the greater
part of the ancient Castilian romances, which have, in
the progress of time, been collected, and have undergone
more or less improvement, were composed at a
much earlier period. One Nicolas, and an abbot
named Antonio, are mentioned as celebrated writers
of romances in the thirteenth century, anterior to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
reign of Alphonso X.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> But until the period of the
invention of printing, no regard was paid by the
learned, or by those who wished to be considered
learned, to popular ballads; and when the attention of
men of letters began at last to be directed to the old
romances, the authors were either forgotten, or no
trouble was taken to preserve or recover their names.
With a view, therefore, to the convenience of historical
arrangement, a particular account of the ancient romance
poetry of Castile may, with propriety, be
postponed until the period when the first instance of
literary publicity, which was given to it, must be
recorded. In the mean while, some little known,
though not unimportant memorials of the state of
poetical and rhetorical culture in the fourteenth
century, may here be brought to recollection.</p>

<h3 id="ALPHONSO_XI">ALPHONSO XI.</h3>

<p>That the example of Alphonso X. operated powerfully
among the grandees of Castile, cannot be doubted;
and to its influence must, in a great measure, be
attributed the encouragement given to the cultivation
of knowledge by Alphonso XI. This prince, amidst
all the troubles of his busy reign, maintained the
character of a protector of learning, and endeavoured
to distinguish himself as a writer in his native tongue.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
In the accounts of his labours given by Spanish authors,
he is stated to have composed a General Chronicle
in Redondillas,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> which is either lost, or still remains
buried in some of the old archives of Spain. However
slight may be the merits of this work, in a
poetical point of view, it is rendered interesting by
the circumstance, that the king chose for the rhythmic
structure of his narrative, the easy flowing verse of
the romances, instead of stiff monkish alexandrines,
and the ungraceful dactylic stanzas. This brought
the redondillas more into favour. Alphonso XI. also
caused books to be written in Castilian prose, among
which were a kind of Peerage, or Register of the
noble families of Castile, with an account of their
hereditary estates and possessions, and a Hunting
Book, (<i>Libro de Monteria</i>,) in the composition of
which several persons assisted. Though rhetorical art
might derive no advantage from these books, they
contributed to give consideration to the national
dialect, and to incite persons of rank to engage in
literary labour.</p>

<h3 id="EARLY_CULTIVATION_OF_CASTILIAN_PROSE">EARLY CULTIVATION OF CASTILIAN PROSE&mdash;DON
JUAN MANUEL; HIS CONDE LUCANOR; HIS
ROMANCES.</h3>

<p>But the most valuable monument of the cultivation
of Spanish eloquence in the fourteenth century is <i>El
Conde Lucanor</i>, a book of moral and political maxims,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
written by Don Juan Manuel, a Castilian prince. This
Don Juan was one of the most distinguished men of his
age.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> He was descended, in a collateral line with the
reigning family of Castile, from king Ferdinand III.
usually called the <span class="smcap">Saint</span>. He served his sovereign
Alphonso XI. with chivalrous fidelity, and by the judicious
policy of his conduct, retained the favour of that
prince, who certainly had reason to regard him with
jealousy. After distinguishing himself by a number of
honourable and gallant deeds, Alphonso appointed him
governor (<i>adelantado mayor</i>) of the country bordering
on the Moorish kingdom of Grenada. In this station
he became the terror of the hereditary enemy of Castile.
He made an irruption into Grenada, and defeated the
Moorish king in a great battle. After this brilliant
victory, he always acted one of the first parts in the
internal troubles of Castile, and during twenty years
conducted the war against the Moors. He died in
1362, leaving behind him some of the ripest fruits of
his experience in his <i>Count Lucanor</i>. A Spanish book,
so full of sound practical good sense, of a character so
truly unostentatious, and clothed in a simple, homely,
but far from inanimate garb, could scarcely be expected
to belong to the fourteenth century. In estimating the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
merit of this work, it ought also to be recollected, that
at the period in which it appeared, the taste for the
wild tales of chivalry called romances had begun to
prevail. Amadis de Gaul, the prototype of all subsequent
knight-errantry romances, had then obtained
general circulation. There is, however, in the <i>Count
Lucanor</i>, no trace of romantic extravagance, none of
the dreaming flights of an irregular imagination; for
in every passage of the book the author shews himself
a man of the world and an observer of human nature.
In the course of his long experience he had formed
maxims for the conduct of life which he was desirous
of pursuing. He gave to many of these axioms a
laconic expression in verse; and, to impress them the
more forcibly, invented his <i>Count Lucanor</i>, a prince
conscious of too limited an understanding to trust to
his own judgment in cases of difficulty. He gives the
Count a minister (<i>consejero</i>), whose wisdom fortunately
supplies the deficiency of his master’s intellect.
When the Count asks advice of his minister, the
latter relates a story, or sometimes a fable. The
application comes at the close, and the narrative is
the commentary of the verse or couplet with which it
terminates. In this manner forty-nine moral and
political tales are told. They are not of equal merit;
but though some are inferior to others, the difference
is not great, and they have all the same rhetorical
form. Sometimes it is the idea that gives the chief
interest, sometimes the execution. Among the versified
maxims are the following.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>“If you have done something good in little, do
it also in great, as the good will never die.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>“He who advises you to be reserved to your
friends, wishes to betray you without witnesses.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>“Hazard not your wealth on a poor man’s advice.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>“He who has got a good seat should not leave it.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>“He who praises you for what you have not,
wishes to take from you what you have.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>This last axiom is deduced from the well-known
fable of the fox and the raven. It is curious to observe
the resemblance between the unconscious artless simplicity
with which Don Juan Manuel relates his fable,
and the finely-studied simplicity with which the
elegant La Fontaine tells the same story. Who would
expect to find in an old Spanish book of the fourteenth
century, the same knowledge of the world and mankind,
as distinguished the refined age of Louis XIV.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>This work appears to have been preserved without
alteration, as it was originally written. It is only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
occasionally that the difference of the language in
single words,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> betrays the officious industry of some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
transcriber. In a short preface, the author gives a
candid explanation of the object of this collection of
tales.</p>

<p>Don Juan Manuel was also the author of a Chronicle
(<i>Chronica de España</i>); the Book of the Sages,
(<i>Libro de los Sabios</i>); a Book of Chivalry, (<i>Libro
del Caballero</i>); and several other works in prose of a
similar nature.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> It appears that these works are now
lost, though they were preserved in manuscript in the
sixteenth century. A collection of Don Juan Manuel’s
poems also existed at that time, according to the
express testimony of Argote y Molina, who published
<i>El Conde Lucanor</i> in the sixteenth century,
and intended to publish those poems likewise. He
calls them coplas; and they certainly were not alexandrines.
After this testimony, it can scarcely be doubted
that some of the romances and songs, which are
attributed, in the <i>Cancionero general</i>, to a Don Juan
Manuel, have this prince for their author.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> But if
such be the fact, then how many of the similar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
romances which are still preserved, may, considering
the greater antiquity of their form, be yet more
ancient!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<h3 id="SATIRICAL_POEM_OF_JUAN_RUYZ">SATIRICAL POEM OF JUAN RUYZ, ARCH-PRIEST OF
HITA.</h3>

<p>Don Juan Manuel had for his contemporary the
author of an allegorical satire, written in Castilian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
alexandrines, or in a kind of verse which may be called
doggrel. The result of the researches of the Spanish
critics ascribes this very singular work to Juan Ruiz,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
arch-priest of Hita, in Castile.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> This writer evidently
possessed a lively imagination; he has personified with
great drollery Lent, the Carnival, and Breakfast, under
the titles of <i>Doña Quaresma</i>, <i>Don Carnal</i>, and
<i>Don Almuerzo</i>; and these and other personages
are placed in a very edifying connection with <i>Don
Amor</i>. The object of the satire is thus apparent,
but the execution is as unskilful as the language is
rude. Only a part of the work has been preserved.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>He, however, who has to record the developement
of true poetic genius, must hasten from this and other
examples of monastic humour and rugged versification,
in order to speak with something like historical precision
of the romances and other lyric compositions
which form the real commencement of Spanish poetry.</p>

<h3 id="MORE_PRECISE_ACCOUNT_OF_THE_ORIGIN">MORE PRECISE ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE
SPANISH POETIC ROMANCES AND SONGS&mdash;PROBABLE
RISE OF THE ROMANCES OF CHIVALRY IN
PROSE&mdash;ORIGINAL RELATIONSHIP OF THE POETIC
AND THE PROSE ROMANCES.</h3>

<p>The latter half of the fourteenth century is the
period when the history of the Spanish romances and
songs, the unknown authors of which yet live in their
verse, though still very defective, begins to acquire
some degree of certainty.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> In the absence, however,
of that particular information which would be desirable,
it becomes necessary to take a view of the
manner of thinking of the Spaniards of that age, in
order to connect the general idea which ought to be
formed of their literary culture, with those scattered
notices which must supply the place of a more
systematic account. It will here be recollected that
the cultivation of Spanish literature received at its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
commencement a national poetic impulse. In constant
conflict with the Moors, and acquainted with oriental
manners and compositions, the Spaniards felt the proper
distinction between poetry and prose, less readily
than that distinction was perceived by any other
people on the first attempt to give a determinate
form to their literature. Popular songs of every kind
were probably indigenous in the Peninsula. The
patriotic Spaniards, like many other ancient nations,
were fond of preserving the memory of remarkable
events in ballads. They also began, at a very early
period, to consider it of importance to record public
transactions in prose. The example of their learned
king Alphonso X. who caused a collection of old
national chronicles to be made, gave birth to many
similar compilations of the history of the country.
But historical criticism, and the historical art, were
then equally unknown. As the giving to an accredited
fact a poetical dress in a song fit to be sung to
a guitar, was not thought inconsistent with the spirit
of genuine national history, still less could the relating
of a fabricated story as a real event in history seem
hostile to the spirit of poetry. Thus the <i>historical
romance</i> in verse, and the <i>chivalric romance</i> in prose,
derived their origin from the confounding of the
limits of epic and historical composition. The history
of Spanish poetical romance is therefore intimately
interwoven with the history of the prose chivalric
romance.</p>

<p>Whoever may have been the author of <i>Amadis
de Gaul</i>, his genius lives in his invention; this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
work soon obscured, even in France, all the other
histories of knights-errant written in latin or french,
by many of which it had been preceded. From the
very careful investigations of several Spanish and
Portuguese writers, it appears that the name of the
real author of the first or genuine Amadis was Vasco
Lobeira, or, according to the Spanish orthography
and pronunciation, Lobera, a native of Portugal, who
flourished about the end of the thirteenth century, and
lived to 1325. It is probable, however, that before the
period at which the work obtained its highest celebrity
both in Spain and France, it had passed through the
hands of several emendators, and it is therefore impossible
to know how much of the book, as it now
exists, belongs to the original author, and how far it
is indebted to the labours of Spanish or French
editors.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> From these circumstances too, it appears
that the work could scarcely be generally known in
Spain before the middle of the fourteenth century;
and its influence on the national literature must, on
that account, have been the greater; for it would be
operating with all the force of novelty, precisely at
the time when the poetic genius of the nation began
to display itself in youthful vigour. What other book
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
could have produced an effect so fascinating on the
minds of the Spanish nobles, as Amadis de Gaul?
The monstrous perversions of history and geography
in that work, did not disturb the illusion of readers
who knew little or nothing of either history or geography.
The prolixity of the narrative gave as little
offence as the stiff formality of the style. Indeed the
virtues of gothic chivalry appear more pure as they
shine through the formal stateliness of the narration.
The author has borrowed nothing from the Arabian
tale-tellers, except the attraction of fairy machinery.
This was, however, a powerful charm, and gave an
epic-colouring to the Amadis, which, joined to the
pathetic descriptions of romantic heroism, produced
an influence over the imagination and feelings of the
age which no former work had possessed. The moral
character of the plan and execution is strangely blended
with a peculiar kind of delicately veiled licence, which
appears to have very well accorded with the spirit of
Spanish chivalry. While the gentle knights, amidst
innumerable adventures of love and heroism, observe
as the chief law of chivalry, the most inviolable fidelity
in all situations towards females as well as males, they
and the ladies with whom they have pledged their
faith, by a secret betrothing, live together without
scruple before marriage, as husband and wife. But
a picture, so true and glowing, of the noblest heroic
feelings and the most unshaken fidelity,&mdash;circumscribing
with no anxious care the boundaries of love’s
dominion, yet admitting no offensively indecorous or
immoral trait,&mdash;displaying the enthusiastic flights of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
an imagination often exalted beyond nature, but
redeemed by an ingenuous simplicity of description
with which even a refined taste must be delighted,&mdash;well
deserved at the time of its appearance that
favour which it continued for ages to enjoy. It is
obvious that more of Spanish than of French features
enter into the character of the chivalry exhibited in
this work. The romantic self-torment of Amadis on
the <i>Peña pobre</i> (barren rock) is one of the striking
Spanish traits. Even the name Beltenebros, given
on this occasion by a pious hermit to the disconsolate
knight, contributes to prove that the work is not of
French origin; for the French paraphrastic translation,
<i>Le beau tenebreux</i>, is not only in itself very insipid,
but poor Amadis appears quite ridiculous when made
to pronounce it from his own mouth as his name.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>When the Amadis, after being widely circulated,
became the object of numerous imitations, the particular
account of which may be left to the explorers of
literary curiosities, it was no longer possible for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
prose romance of knight-errantry and the ballad romance
to disown their relationship. At this period the
romance poetry obtained a consideration which it had
not previously enjoyed. Songs which were formerly
disregarded were now carefully noted down. Those
poetic romances, the materials for which are taken from
histories of knights-errant, are among the oldest of the
Spanish ballads which have been preserved in the
ancient language and form. Some are imitations from
the Spanish Amadis, others are translations from the
French; and it may here be observed, that the Spaniards
and the French possessed at this period a body
of romantic literature, which was throughout its
whole extent nearly the same to both countries.&mdash;With
the old poetic romances, derived from books of
chivalry, are closely connected the most ancient of
the historical ballads founded on the history of the
country. The latter, it may be presumed, soon transferred
their national tone and character into the former.
But it was not until after they had given to each other
a reciprocal support, that the historical romance found
a place in Spanish literature. They also mutually
declined from the height of their common celebrity,
and at last sunk again into the obscurity attached to
pieces of mere popular recreation. In this way, however,
they have retained an oral currency among the
common people down to the present age. The Spanish
critics notice them too briefly, as if they were afraid
to depreciate the dignity of their literature by dwelling
on the antiquated and homely effusions of the poetic
genius of their unlettered ancestors. But a people
free from this prejudice who can admire simple and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
natural, as well as learned and artificial poetry, and
who set little or no value on the latter, when it entirely
separates itself from the former, will be disposed
to see justice more impartially distributed to the old
Spanish romances.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<h3 id="THE_DIFFERENT_KINDS_OF_POETIC_ROMANCE">THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF POETIC ROMANCE.</h3>

<p>The romances composed on subjects derived from
the fictions of chivalry, which have been preserved in
the collections, are distinguished by the old forms of
the language, and the primitive mode of repeating a
single rhyme, which often becomes a mere assonance,
from the romances of a later date, though even these
have long since been called old. Amadis de Gaul appears
to have contributed very little to this kind of ballad.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
The great number and the longest of the romances are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
taken from the fabulous adventures of Charlemagne and
his Paladins. In them we again meet with the twelve
peers of France, who figure in the poems of Boyardo
and Ariosto, with the addition of Don Gayferos, the
Moor Calaynos, and other poetic characters, to
whom the Spanish public were the more readily disposed
to grant an historical existence, in consequence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
of the chivalric history of Charlemagne’s Paladins
(who are represented to have fought like the Spaniards
against the Moors,) being held in great respect as a
supplemental part of Spanish National History. In
progress of time, however, the romance of the Moor
Calaynos became the subject of a proverb, employed
to denote verses in an old exploded and vulgar style.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
The ballad of the <i>Conde Alarcos</i>, who with his own
hands strangled his lady in satisfaction to the honour,
and in obedience to the commands of his king, appears
to have had its origin in some romantic work of chivalry.
This and two other romances which relate
how the youthful Don Gayferos avenged the death of
his father, are among the best to which knight-errantry
has given birth; though in the remaining specimens of
this kind of ballad, the poetic genius of the age occasionally
displays itself in all its energetic simplicity.
The authors of these romances paid little regard to
ingenuity of invention, and still less to correctness of
execution. When an impressive story of poetical
character was found, the subject and the interest belonging
to it were seized with so much truth and
feeling, that the parts of the little piece, the brief
labour of untutored art, linked themselves together,
as it were, spontaneously; and the imagination of the
bard had no higher office than to give to the situations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
a suitable colouring and effect. This he performed
without study or effort, and painted them more or less
successfully according to the inspiration, good or bad,
of the moment. These antique, racy effusions of a
pregnant poetic imagination, scarcely conscious of its
own productive power, are nature’s genuine offspring.
To recount their easily recognized defects and faults
is as superfluous, as it would be impossible by any
critical study to imitate a single trait of that noble
simplicity which constitutes their highest charm.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>The simplicity of the old historical romances is
still more remarkable. They form altogether a mere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
collection of anecdotes of Spanish history, from the
invasion of the Moors, to the period when the authors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
of the romances flourished. Neither the materials nor
the interest of the situations owe any thing to the
invention of these simple bards. They never ventured
to embellish with fictitious circumstances, stories which
were already in themselves interesting, lest they
should deprive their ballads of historical credit. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the historical romances the story displays none of
those entanglements and developements which distinguish
some of the longer romances of chivalry. They
are simple pictures of single situations only. The
poetic representation of the details which give effect
to the situation is almost the only merit which can be
attributed to the narrators, and they employed no
critical study to obtain it. In this way were thousands
of these romances destined to be composed, and partly
preserved, partly forgotten, without one of their authors
acquiring the reputation of a great poet. It was
regarded rather as an instance of good fortune than
a proof of talent, when the author of a romance was
particularly successful in painting an interesting situation.
In general their efforts did not carry them
beyond mediocrity, but mediocrity was not discouraged,
for it depended entirely on accident, or perhaps some
secondary causes, whether a romance became popular
or sunk into oblivion. It would require a separate
treatise to discuss in a satisfactory manner, the degree
of merit which belongs to these national ballads, the
immense number of which defies calculation. Many
little, and upon the whole very unimportant specimens
are still worthy of preservation, on account of some
one single trait which each exhibits. Others, on the
contrary, excite attention by the happy combination
of a number of traits in themselves minute and of
little value; again, a third class is distinguished by a
sonorous rhythm not to be found in the rest. Unfortunately,
no literary critic has yet taken the trouble to
arrange these pieces in anything like a chronological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
order. Until this be done, it cannot be discovered
how the historical romance gradually advanced from its
original rudeness to the degree of relative beauty
which it at last attained, though it could not rise to
classic perfection, as that kind of composition never
acquired the rank or consideration of classic poetry
in Spain.</p>

<p>Among the most ancient historical romances are
several, the subjects of which have been taken from
the earliest periods of Spanish history, anterior to the
age of the Cid. Like the romances derived from the
prose works of chivalry, they have only a single rhyme
which interchanges with blank verse, and which is
frequently lost in a simple assonance.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> The romances
of the Cid, of which more than a hundred still exist,
are either of a more recent date, or have, at least, been
in a great measure modernized.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> In some a series of
regularly arranged assonances may be perceived.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Others are divided into stanzas, with a burden repeated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
at the close of each.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> In the greater part, however,
the rhyme almost wholly disappears, and only an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
accidental assonance occasionally occurs. This form
also prevails in most of the romances founded on the
history of the Moors. Their number is very great,
perhaps greater than that of those derived from events
of Spanish history; and this abundance might well
excite as much astonishment in the critic as it has
given offence to some orthodox Spaniards.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> But even
the Spaniards of old Castilian origin found a certain
poetic charm in the oriental manners of the Moors.
On the other hand, the European chivalry, in so far as
it was adopted by the Moors, became more imposing
from its union with oriental luxury, which favoured
the display of splendid armour, waving plumes, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
emblematical ornaments of every kind. The Moorish
principalities or kingdoms were even more agitated by
internal troubles, and acts of violence, than the christian
states; and in the former, particularly, when different
races powerfully opposed each other, the lives of celebrated
warriors were more fertile in interesting anecdotes
than in the latter. The Christian warriors, it
also appears, had sufficient generosity to allow justice
to be done, at least to the distinguished leaders of
their enemies, who are described in an old romance, as
<i>gentlemen, though infidels</i>.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> Besides, all these romances,
whether of Moorish or Spanish history, whether
more ancient or more modern, present nearly the
same unsophisticated character and the same artless style
of composition. The subject is generally founded on
a single fact. Thus, for example, <i>Roderick</i>, or <i>Don
Rodrigo</i>, the last king of the Goths in Spain, before
the Moorish invasion, takes flight after his total overthrow,
and bewails his own and his country’s fate;
and this is sufficient for a romance.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The Cid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
returns victorious from his exile, alights from his
horse before a church, and delivers a short energetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
speech; this again forms the whole subject of a romance.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
In others, with equal simplicity of story:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the king joins the hands of the Cid and Ximena,
invests him with fiefs of castles and territories, the
names of which are all recorded, and thus makes
preparation for the marriage of the lovers.&mdash;The Cid
lays aside his armour and puts on his wedding
garments, which are minutely described from the hat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
to the boots.&mdash;At a tournament the Moorish knight
Ganzul enters the lists on a fiery steed; the beautiful
Zayda, who has been unfaithful to him, once more
yields up her heart to her lover, and confesses to the
Moorish ladies who surround her the emotion she
experiences.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>&mdash;The Moorish hero Abenzulema, who
has filled the prisons with Christian knights,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
exiled by his jealous prince, takes leave of his beloved
Balaja.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Such is the nature of a countless number
of these ballads. In general, the ornaments of the
armour, and the device of the knight, which must harmonize
with these ornaments, are minutely described.
Were an artist of genius to study these interesting
situations, he would open to himself a new field for
historical painting.</p>

<p>There is a kind of mythological romance in which
the heroes of Greece appear in Spanish costume, which
may be regarded as an imitation of the species already
described. The history of the siege of Troy, having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
been clothed in the garb of a chivalric romance, it
followed, as a matter of course, that the Grecian
heroes should be exhibited as knights-errant in the
poetic romances. It is obvious, on examination, that
most of these mythological romances are very old.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
Even christianity is made to contribute to this kind of
composition, and anecdotes from the bible are related
in the favourite romance form; as, for example, the
lamentation of king David on the death of his son
Absalom.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>

<h3 id="CASTILIAN_POETRY_IN_THE_THIRTEENTH">CASTILIAN POETRY IN THE THIRTEENTH AND
FOURTEENTH CENTURIES.</h3>

<p>In ancient Spanish poetry the strictly lyric romances
do not form a different class from the narrative romances.
On the contrary, these kinds are inseparably
confounded. In like manner, no essential distinction
between what was called a <i>cancion</i> (song), and a
lyric romance, was established either in theory or
in practice. A custom prevailed of classing, without
distinction, under the general name of romance, any
lyric expression of the feelings which ran on, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
popular manner, in a string of redondillas, without
distinct strophes, and which, in that respect resembled
the greater part of the narrative romances.
When, however, the composition was divided into little
strophes, or coplas, it was usually called a <i>cancion</i>,
a term employed in nearly the same indeterminate
sense as the word <i>song</i> in English, or <i>lied</i> in German,
but which does not correspond with the Italian <i>canzone</i>.
The same name, however, came afterwards to
be applied to lyric pieces of greater research and more
elevated character, if they were divided into strophes.
Compositions in coplas must have been common in
Spain about the middle of the fourteenth century; for
the traces of their origin lead back to the ancient
Spanish custom of accompanying such songs, in the
true style of national poetry, with dances. The
saraband is one of those old national dances, during
the performance of which coplas were sung. Hence
the Spanish proverb denoting antiquated and trivial
poetry, when it is said of verses that “they are not
worth as much as the coplas of the saraband,” in
the same way as the romance of Calainos is quoted
proverbially.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> But many lyric compositions which
are preserved in the collections of the most ancient
of the pieces known by the general name of romances,
are probably of an older date than those in coplas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
which appear in the <i>Cancioneros</i>. They have, like
the older romances, only a single rhyme, alternating
with assonances and blank verses; but, independently
of this proof, their old language, which corresponds
so naturally with the ingenuous simplicity of their
manner, is sufficient to mark their antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>The Castilian lyric poetry seems to have begun to
confer reputation on those who cultivated it, in the
latter half of the fourteenth century. The Marquis
of Santillana, who lived in the first half of the
fifteenth century, relates that his grandfather composed
very good songs, and among others some, the first lines
of which he quotes.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> According to the statement
of the Marquis, a Spanish jew, named Rabbi Santo,
celebrated as the author of maxims in verse, flourished
about the same time. He also informs us, that during
the reign of John I. from 1379 to 1390, Alfonso
Gonzales de Castro, and some other poets, were
esteemed for their lyric compositions. But all these
names, so honoured in their own age, were forgotten
in the commencement of the fifteenth century, when
under the reign of John II. there arose a new race
of poets, who outshone all their predecessors.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<h3 id="POETICAL_COURT_OF_JOHN_II">POETICAL COURT OF JOHN II.</h3>

<p>The Spanish authors make the reign of John II.
the commencement of an epoch in their poetry. But
though some poetic essays of greater compass than had
previously been undertaken, were then produced, still
this period ought really to be regarded only as that in
which the ancient poetry received its last improvement,
and by no means as constituting a new era. The old
national muse of Castile continued the favourite of
many of the grandees of the kingdom who were
ambitious, in imitation of Alphonso X. of uniting the
reputation of learning to the fame of their poetry, but
who had more true poetic feeling than that monarch.
These noble authors thought they could acquire little
honour by devoting their attention to the composition
of romances, properly so called, but preferred distinguishing
themselves by giving to lyric poetry a
higher degree of art in its forms, and more ingenuity
of invention. As a consequence of this taste, they
displayed a particular fondness for allegory, and
ingenious difficulties and subtilties of every kind
were the great objects of their labours. Their best
works are some compositions in which they seem
unconsciously to have allowed nature to speak, and
these specimens possess about the same value as the
anonymous romances. They brought the dactylic
stanzas (<i>versos de arte mayor</i>,) again into vogue,
because such artificial strophes had a more learned
air than the easy flowing redondillas. Mythological
illusions and moral sentences were, with these authors,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the usual substitutes for true poetic dignity. But
barbarous as was their taste, nature, which they
wished to renounce, sometimes worked so powerfully
within them, that she triumphed over the pedantic
refinement to which they had surrendered their understandings;&mdash;and
the graceful facility of the popular
manner occasionally appeared in their writings. In
this way the ancient national poetry became amalgamated
with works distinguished for laborious efforts
of art, and ultimately attained a higher degree of
consideration. There resulted, however, no revolution
in the literature of Spain; and it cannot be said, that
the authors of the age of John II. formed an epoch,
unless it be for having introduced, with more success
than Alphonso X. learning and philosophy into the
sphere of poetry; and for having, besides, by their
united endeavours, given to the ancient lyric forms of
their maternal language, that sort of improvement
which, consistently with the spirit of the age, they
were capable of receiving, and which finally brought
them to their highest state of perfection.</p>

<p>But this period of brilliant improvement in the
ancient national poetry of Spain is, in another respect,
more memorable than the writers on Spanish literature
appear to have regarded it. During the whole period
the Castilian monarchy was convulsed by internal
troubles. Even in the last ten years of the fourteenth
century, the powerful barons of the kingdom had
almost wrested the sceptre from the hands of John I.
and Henry III. Under John II. the celebrated patron
of poetry, who reigned from 1407 to 1454, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
monarchy was more than once menaced with destruction.
The grandees sported with the royal prerogatives,
and John II. had not sufficient firmness
of character to render his authority respected. In
the difficult situations in which he was involved, he
derived, in a certain measure, his security from his
love of literature, which yielded a valuable return for
the favours he had bestowed. It won and preserved
for him the attachment of many of the most considerable
noblemen of the country, who formed around
him a poetical court, which was not without influence
on public affairs. It would not be easy to find in the
history of states and of literature, another instance of
a similar court, with the members composing it, at
once poets, warriors, and statesmen, surrounding and
supporting a learned sovereign, in spite of his imbecility,
during a period of civil commotion. This
phenomenon proves the supremacy of the poetic spirit
at this time in Spain, since it was not to be subdued
even by the spirit of political faction, which is always
hostile to poetry, and which was, at this time, particularly
powerful.</p>

<h3 id="THE_MARQUIS_OF_VILLENA">THE MARQUIS OF VILLENA.</h3>

<p>Previously to this period, before the poets had
rendered the court of John II. the most brilliant
society of the age, an eminent nobleman, the Marquis
Enrique de Villena, was distinguished for his
literary efforts. He sought to adorn his erudition
with the lyric graces of the Limosin Troubadours,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
who had then attained their highest and final celebrity
at the court of Arragon; and, thus united, to adapt
both the learning and the poetry to the Castilian taste.
He seemed called by birth to the performance of this
task; for he was descended by the paternal side from
the kings of Arragon, and by the maternal from those
of Castile. His reputation for metaphysical and natural
knowledge was so great, that he came, at last, in that
ignorant age, to be regarded as a magician, and on that
account he and his books were never mentioned but
with horror. His talent for poetic invention was,
however, an object of particular admiration with many
of the poets of the age of John II. and among others
of the Marquis de Santillana and Juan de Mena.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Villena was the author of an
allegorical drama, which was performed at the court of
Arragon in celebration of a marriage, and which may,
therefore, be supposed to have been written in the
Limosin rather than in the Castilian language.
Among the characters stated to have been introduced
into this drama, are <i>Justice</i>, <i>Truth</i>, <i>Peace</i>, and <i>Clemency</i>.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
Rhetorical and poetical competitions were
instituted at Toulouse, in the year 1324, under the
name of the <i>Floral Games</i>, to foster, by prizes and
gallant ceremonies, the Troubadour spirit. This institution,
which was soon after imitated in Arragon, was
transplanted by the Marquis of Villena to Castile, but
the result of that enterprize was not successful.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Marquis died at Madrid in 1434. A work supposed to
have been printed at Burgos in 1499, under the title of
<i>Los trabajos de Hercules</i>, (The Labours of Hercules),
used formerly to be quoted as one of his poems; but
from more recent investigations, it appears that this
pretended poem was a mythological tale in prose.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> A
translation of the Æneid by the Marquis, is besides
mentioned, but this work appears also to be lost. A
kind of art of poetry, which he wrote under the title
of <i>La Gaya Ciencia</i>, has been more fortunate; for it
has been partially preserved, and is still regarded with
respect as the oldest work of the kind in the Spanish
language.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> This treatise, however, does not deserve
to be called an Art of Poetry, except in a very limited
sense. It must have been intended as a necessary
instruction, in the first place, for the Marquis of
Santillana, to whom it is directly addressed, and doubtless,
in the next, for the other members of the Institute
of the Gay Science, (<i>El Consistorio de la gaya Ciencia</i>),
which the Marquis of Villena had formed in Castile.
In conformity with this object, the author relates the
history of the Institute, endeavours to prove its utility,
takes that opportunity of expressing his opinion on the
object of poetry in general, and concludes with laying
down the principles of Castilian prosody. These principles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
appear to have been particularly useful with reference
to the conflict which then subsisted between the Castilian
and Limosin tongues. Among his general
observations on poetry, he says&mdash;“Great are the
benefits which this science confers on civil society, by
banishing indolence, and employing noble minds in
laudable speculations: other nations have, accordingly,
wished for and established among themselves, schools
of this science, by which it has been diffused over
different parts of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> It is obvious that this
active nobleman was full of zeal for the improvement
of the poetry of his country, and for the honour of
that art which was cultivated with method and dignity
in the Arragonian provinces, but which in Castile,
where it was left to itself, appeared to stand in need
of direction and encouragement. The difference
between science and art was not more clearly perceived
by the Marquis of Villena than by the other
poets and men of learning of his age; and to distinguish
the Castilian forms of romantic poetry from
the Limosin, did not appear to him necessary. Thus,
while his labours contributed to heighten the respect
in which poetry and liberal pursuits were held, they
had only an indirect influence on the improvement of
Castilian poetry.

<h3 id="THE_MARQUIS_OF_SANTILLANA">THE MARQUIS OF SANTILLANA; HIS POETICAL
WORKS; HIS HISTORICAL AND CRITICAL LETTER.</h3>

<p>After the death of the Marquis of Villena, his
pupil, Don Iñigo Lopez de Mendoza, Marquis of
Santa Juliana, or Santillana, appears at the head of
the brilliant society of poets who adorned the court
of John II. Whenever a Marquis of Santillana is
mentioned in the history of Spanish literature, without
any more particular description, it is this nobleman
that is meant. He was born in the year 1398. His
elevated rank and great fortune, joined to the military
and political talents by which he was distinguished
from youth upwards, placed him in a situation in
which he was called upon to perform a principal
part among the nobles of Castile. His intellectual culture
had for its basis the philosophy of Socrates; and
his strict morality procured him no less celebrity than
his sound understanding and love of science.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> This
uncommon union of rank, influence, character, talents,
and learning, could not fail to render the Marquis of
Santillana highly respected; and he was indeed regarded
as so extraordinary a man, that foreigners are
said to have undertaken journies to Castile for the
sole purpose of seeing him. He was greatly esteemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
by king John, who, during the civil wars, constantly
received from him, in return, the homage which was
due to a protector of learning, though the Marquis
was not always of that prince’s party. After the
death of John II. in the latter years of his life, this
eminent man assisted with his counsels Henry IV.
under whom the regal authority in Castile was subsequently
almost annihilated. He died in the year
1458.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Santillana possessed no uncommon
poetic talent. But he studied to give to the poetry of
his age a moral tendency, to extend its sphere by
allegorical invention, and to adorn poetic description
with the stores of learning. Two poems, in which he
has best succeeded in realizing these objects, are also
the most celebrated of his works. The first is an
elegy on the death of the Marquis of Villena;<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> a
lyric allegory in twenty-five dactylic stanzas, constructed
according to the ancient form. The idea is
very simple, and the commencement of the piece
brings to recollection the hell of Dante, of which it
is probably an imitation.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> The poet loses himself in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
a desert, finds himself surrounded by wild and frightful
animals, advances forward, hears dismal tones of
lamentation, and finally discovers some nymphs in
mourning, who bewail the loss and chaunt the merits
of the deceased Marquis of Villena. On this poem,
which does not discover much ingenuity of invention,
the Marquis of Santillana probably expended all his
stock of learning. He cites as many deities and
ancient authors, as the nature of his work will permit
him to notice.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Such a display of erudition had
never before been seen in the Castilian language. No
genial poetic spirit is to be found except in the
descriptions and in some other scattered passages of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
this lyric allegory;<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> but the verse is not destitute
of harmony. The other considerable poem of the
Marquis, consists of a series of moral reflections,
occasioned by the unfortunate fate of Don Alvaro de
Luna, the favourite of John II.; the Marquis called
this work, <i>El doctrinal de Privados</i>, (the Manual of
Favourites.) It must be regarded as the earliest
didactic poem in the Spanish language, unless that
title be given to any series of moral maxims in verse.
The work which is divided into fifty-three stanzas
in redondillas, receives a poetic colouring from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
manner in which the shade of Don Alvaro is introduced
confessing his faults, and uttering those moral
truths, which the author wished to impress on the
hearts of the restless Castilians.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> He was less successful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
in his love songs composed in the Castilian
manner, to which he unfortunately thought a new
dignity would be given, by rendering them the
vehicles of learned allusions. He possessed, however,
the art of reconciling this pedantry with a pleasing
style of versification.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> A kind of hymn, which he
composed, under the title of <i>Los Gozos de neustra
Señora</i>, (the Joys of our Lady) has been preserved, but
it possesses no poetic merit.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> He also wrote a collection
of proverbs and maxims in verse, for the use of
the Prince Royal of Castile, who afterwards ascended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
a tottering throne under the title of Henry IV.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
However low a critical examination might reduce the
value of these works, still the Marquis of Santillana
deserves to retain the place assigned to him in the
history of Spanish literature by his contemporaries,
by whom he was generally admired, as the “representative
of the honour of poetry.”</p>

<p>Among the literary remains of the Marquis of
Santillana, the critical and historical letter is particularly
remarkable. This letter, which is frequently
mentioned in the early accounts of Spanish poetry,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
is instructive in various respects. It affords the means
of accurately observing the infancy of Spanish criticism
in that age, for the Marquis has added to the letter
a collection of his ingenious maxims, (<i>decires</i>,) and
of his poems for Don Pedro, a Portuguese prince;
and from the embarrassment evinced by the Marquis
when he attempts to give the prince an account of
the rise of Castilian poetry, it is obvious, that with
respect to the real origin of that poetry, less was
understood at that time than is known at the present
day. Poetry, or the gay science, is, according to the
Marquis of Santillana, “an invention of useful things,
which being enveloped in a beautiful veil, are arranged,
exposed, and concealed according to a certain calculation,
measurement, and weight.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Thus, allegory
appeared to him to belong to the essence of poetry.
He could scarcely have imbibed this opinion from
Dante. In Spain, as well as in Italy and France, it
seems to have issued forth from the monkish cells,
when endeavours were made to unite poetry with philosophy,
and to make the poetic art the symbol of
knowledge, in order to ensure to it estimation among
the learned. The allegorical spirit which pervades the
half gothic poetry of that period, is therefore inseparably
connected with the characteristic origin of
modern poetry. The Marquis of Santillana would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
have come to a totally different conclusion, had he
taken an unprejudiced view of the genuine national
poetry of his country. But he imagined he was
laying down a principle which would ennoble it, when,
according to his theory, he held allegory to be indispensable.
Without scruple, therefore, he confounded the
Castilian and Limosin poetry together in one mass.
Respecting the origin of the former, he entered into
no investigation. He commences the history of poetry
with Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon, and Job,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> gives
a copious account of the changes which the art of the
Troubadours had undergone in the Arragonian provinces,
and adds a notice of some of the earliest
Galician and Portuguese poets: among the Castilian
poets, he mentions king Alphonso and some others,
without saying a syllable on the subject of the ancient
romances.</p>

<h3 id="JUAN_DE_MENA">JUAN DE MENA.</h3>

<p>Juan de Mena, who is by some writers, styled
the Spanish Ennius, ranks, as a poet, in a somewhat
higher scale than the Marquis of Santillana, though
he was less favoured by fortune, and was not distinguished
by so many various merits as the latter.
He was born in Cordova, about the year 1412. In
this southern district of Spain, which but a short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
time before had been recovered from the Moors, the
Castilian genius was doubtless very rapidly naturalized.
Juan de Mena, though not descended from a family of
rank,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> was not of mean origin, and at the early age
of three-and-twenty he was invested with a civil
appointment in his native city. His own inclination,
however, prompted him to devote himself to philosophy,
and particularly to the study of ancient
literature and history. From Cordova he went to the
University of Salamanca. But in order more nearly
to approach the source of ancient literature, he undertook
a journey to Rome, where he zealously prosecuted
his studies. Enriched with knowledge, he returned
to his native country, and immediately attracted the
notice of the Marquis of Santillana, and shortly after
of king John. Both received him into their literary
circles with distinguished approbation. The Marquis
of Santillana attached himself with more friendship to
Juan de Mena than to any other poet who enjoyed the
favour of the king, although their political opinions did
not always coincide. The king nominated him one of
the historiographers, who, according to the arrangement
which had subsisted since the time of Alphonso X. were
appointed to continue the national chronicles. Juan de
Mena lived in high favour at the court of John II.
and was a constant adherent of the king. He died
in 1456, at Guadalaxara, in New Castile, being then
about forty-five years of age. The Marquis of Santillana
erected a monument to his memory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>From the history of Juan de Mena’s life, it might
be expected that his endeavours to extend the
boundaries of Castilian poetry would be made
under the influence of Italian taste, more or less of
which he may be presumed to have adopted, and on
his return introduced into his native country. But no
Italian poet, save Dante, appears to have produced
any remarkable impression on him. Indeed, with the
exception of Dante and Petrarch, there was, at that
period, no Italian poet of classic consideration; and in
the first half of the fifteenth century Italian poetry suddenly
declined. Sonnets were still in favour throughout
the whole of Italy, but Juan de Mena continued faithful
to the old forms of the Castilian poetry, perhaps
from a feeling of national pride. He certainly did not
imitate the sonnet; and even from Dante himself, he
copied neither metrical form nor style. In allegory
alone he followed the footsteps of the Italian poet.
His most celebrated poem is, the Labyrinth, (<i>el Labyrintho</i>)
or, the Three Hundred Stanzas (<i>las trecientas</i>,)
an allegorical historical didactic work, in old dactylic
verse (<i>versos de arte mayor</i>.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>) Had the Labyrinth
proved what, according to the idea of the author, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
was intended to be, it would have been proper, merely
on account of that single work, to commence a new
epoch of Spanish poetry with the reign of John II.
But with all its merits, which have been highly extolled
by some authors, and which are certainly by no means
trivial, it can only be regarded as a mere specimen of
gothic art.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> It belongs to the period which gave it
birth, and bears no traces of the superiority of a genius
which might have ruled the spirit of the age. Juan
de Mena formed the grand design of executing in this
work an allegorical picture of the whole course of
human life. His intention was, to embrace every age,
to immortalize great virtues, to stigmatize with opprobrium
great vices, and to represent in striking colours
the irresistible power of destiny.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> But the poetical
invention of Juan de Mena was subordinate to his
false learning. The three hundred stanzas, of which
the poem consists, are divided into seven orders,
(<i>ordenes</i>), in imitation of the seven planets, the influence
of which, according to Juan de Mena’s doctrine,
is wisely prescribed by Providence. To represent this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
influence figuratively, Mena resorted to a most insipid
and grotesque invention. After invoking Apollo and
Calliope, and earnestly apostrophising Fortune,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> he
loses himself in imitation of Dante in an allegorical
world, where a female of astonishing beauty appears to
him, and becomes his guide. This female is Providence:<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>
she conducts him to three wheels, two of
which are motionless, while the third is in a state of
continual movement. These wheels, it will readily be
conjectured, represent the past, the present, and the
future. Human beings drop down through this mill
of time. The centre wheel turns them round. Each
has his name and destiny inscribed on his forehead.
While the wheel of the present is revolving with all
the existing human race, it is controlled astrologically
in its motion by the seven orders or circles of the seven
planets under the influence of which men are born.
Whether or not these circles are perceptible on the wheel
itself, is not clearly stated. To this description succeeds,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
in the order of the seven planets, a long gallery of mythological
and historical pictures, which presents abundant
fruits of the poet’s extensive reading. This grotesque
composition is interspersed with individual passages of
great interest and beauty, though none of the traits
call to mind similar traits in Dante. The most glowing
passages of the lyric, didactic, and narrative class, are
those in which Juan de Mena gives utterance to the
language of Spanish patriotism.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> He is particularly
successful in the description of the death of the Count de
Niebla, a Spanish naval hero, who attempted to recover
Gibraltar from the Moors; but through ignorance of the
return of the tide, fell a sacrifice to the waves, because
he preferred perishing with his men, to saving himself
singly.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> But particular attention is bestowed on Don
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
Alvaro de Luna,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> the favourite of the king, who is
introduced in this poem with great pomp, under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
constellation of Saturn. When Juan de Mena wrote
this poem, and thus proclaimed the glory of de Luna,
the latter had not yet fallen, and the energy of his
character seemed to promise, as the poet prophesied,
that he would ultimately triumph over all the Castilian
nobles who had excited the hostility of the country
against him. King John, as may naturally be supposed,
is in Juan de Mena’s Labyrinth complimented
on every suitable occasion. A genealogy of the kings
of Spain forms the conclusion of the poem; and thus
were the Spaniards made to feel a kind of national
interest for the whole work, which in some measure
subsists, at least among their writers at the present day.
Even in Juan de Mena’s time, the learned solecisms
with which he endeavoured to elevate his poetic
language were uncommon;<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> but other essential faults,
such, for instance, as Aristotelian definitions in verse,
were then esteemed great beauties; and the gothic
and fantastic hyperboles in praise of king John, with
which the poem opens, as if intended to appal the
reader at the outset, were not at that period considered
unpoetic.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>But king John was not satisfied with the torrent
of praise which was poured upon him by Mena’s Labyrinth.
The king, with critical gravity, signified his
wish that the poet should add sixty-five stanzas to the
three hundred which he had already written, so that
by making the number of stanzas correspond with the
number of days in the year, the beauty of the composition
might be heightened. The sixty-five new
stanzas were also to have a political tendency, with the
view of recalling the rebellious nobles to their allegiance.
Juan de Mena proceeded to the prescribed
task; but he could produce no more than twenty-four
additional stanzas (<i>coplas añadidas</i>.) They are contained
in the <i>Cancionero general</i>.</p>

<p>Another work of Juan de Mena, very celebrated at
the period when the poet flourished, is his Ode for the
Poetical Coronation of the Marquis of Santillana.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
That Mecænas sometimes vied with him in the composition
of ingenious questions, or enigmas and their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
answers, which were versified by both in dactylic
stanzas.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> His other poems are, for the most part, love
songs, in the style of the age, and according to the
perverted taste of the poet, loaded with mythological
learning. In the course of this work further notice
will be taken of these songs, together with other amatory
poems of the same period. During the last
year of his life, Juan de Mena was engaged in a moral
allegorical poem, which, however, he did not complete.
It was entitled a Treatise on Vices and Virtues, (<i>Tractado
de Vicios y Virtudes</i>.) The author intended in
an epic poem to represent the “more than civil war,”
which the will, instigated by the passions, maintains
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
with reason.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> The will and reason are in the end
personified.</p>

<p>To collect biographical notices of the other poets
and writers of verse who enjoyed the favour of
king John II. and whose works are partly contained
in the <i>Cancionero general</i>, or to give an extensive
account of their productions, is a task which must be
resigned to the author who has made this department
of Spanish literature his particular study. As to poetic
value, the writings of all those authors are in the main
the same; and it may therefore be presumed that it
will prove more instructive to consider works so nearly
related to each other, under the comprehensive view
of general criticism. A few notices, however, of men
worthy of more particular remembrance, may precede
the critical comparison of their works.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<h3 id="PEREZ_DE_GUZMAN">PEREZ DE GUZMAN, RODRIGUEZ DEL PADRON, AND
OTHER SPANISH LYRIC POETS OF THE AGE
OF JOHN II.</h3>

<p>Fernan Perez de Guzman was held in no trifling
consideration at the court of John II. His family,
which was one of the most distinguished in Castile,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
was related to all the other great families in the country.
As a poet, he studied to combine the peculiar tone of
moral and spiritual poetry with that of the old romances.
His Representation of the Four Cardinal
Virtues, dedicated to the Marquis of Santillana, which
consists of sixty-four strophes or couplets, is versified
in redondillas, as are also his <i>Ave Maria</i>, his <i>Paternoster</i>,
and his other spiritual songs.</p>

<p>Rodriguez del Padron seems likewise to have been
held in some esteem at the court of John II. His
family name is not known, and as little are the dates
of his birth and death, but he is named after the place
of his nativity, the little town El Padron in Galicia.
It is remarkable that in his poetry he dropped his
Galician idiom and adopted the Castilian. Besides
the reputation he obtained by his poetic productions,
which are chiefly love songs, he is celebrated for his
friendship with the Galician poet Macias, who will be
further mentioned in the history of Portuguese poetry.
The tragical death of Macias, who fell a sacrifice to
his romantic susceptibility, made such an impression on
Rodriguez del Padron, that he shut himself up in a
Dominican cloister, which he had erected at his own
expense. He became a monk, and terminated his life
in that convent.</p>

<p>Alonzo de Santa Maria, called also Alonzo de Cartagena,
wrote love songs, probably in his youth, and
then devoted himself to spiritual affairs. He died
Archbishop of Burgos, in the year 1456.</p>

<p>Several other poets whose works fill the <i>Cancionero
general</i>, also lived in the reign, or rather under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
anticipated domination of queen Isabella, who, in the
year 1465, vouchsafed to her almost dethroned brother,
Henry IV. the little authority, which, as a nominal
king he retained till his death in 1474. At this
troubled period Garci Sanchez de Badajoz sang his
passionate and glowing songs of love; and at the same
time flourished the two Manriques, Gomez Manrique
and Jorge Manrique; the latter was nephew to the
former. Both owed the consideration they enjoyed no
less to their poetical works than to their high and pure
Castilian descent. The Bachelor de la Torre, of whom
nothing further is known than what his own songs
express, lived at the same period.</p>

<h3 id="OF_THE_CANCIONERO_GENERAL">OF THE CANCIONERO GENERAL, AND THE DIFFERENT
KINDS OF ANCIENT SPANISH SONGS.</h3>

<p>Between the works of the above poets, all of which
are to be found in the <i>Cancionero general</i>, and the
other poems contained in the same collection, whether
their authors lived in the first or the second half of the
fifteenth century, there is a very striking resemblance.
This collection, so remarkable in its kind, may therefore
be regarded as a single work, which, together with a
portion of the General Romance Book (<i>Romancero
general</i>), embraces nearly all the Castilian poetry of the
fifteenth century. No other remains of Spanish poetry,
belonging to the same age, are sufficiently important to
be brought into comparison with this national treasure.
It may not, then, be improper to introduce here, a few
particulars respecting the history of the <i>Cancionero</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
<i>general</i>. Of the <i>Romancero general</i> some further account
must hereafter be given.</p>

<p>The bibliographic notices towards the history of
the collections of Spanish poetry, to be found in the
works of various authors, readily explain why many
old Spanish poems and names of poets have been either
totally lost, or are still only preserved in manuscript in a
way which renders them foreign to literature. It appears
that having been withheld from the press, on the introduction
of printing into Spain,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> they were forgotten as
soon as other collections were made known by means of
that art. In the reign of John II. Alphonso de Baena,
who himself wrote in verse, prepared a collection of
old lyric pieces, under the title of <i>Cancionero de Poetas
Antiguos</i>. This collection, though still preserved in
the library of the Escurial, was never printed;<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> but
a list of the poets whose works are contained in it,
has appeared, and includes names which do not
occur elsewhere. Alvarez de Villapandino is mentioned
as a particularly excellent “master and patron
of the said art,” namely, poetry. Sanchez Salavera,
Ruy Paez de Ribera, and others, of whom besides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
their names, nothing else is known, are also cited. It
is not very probable that Alphonso de Baena’s collection
was the origin of that which subsequently appeared
under the title of the <i>Cancionero general</i>. Of this
celebrated collection it is merely known that it was
originally produced by Fernando del Castillo, at the
commencement of the sixteenth century, and within a
short period frequently augmented and reprinted. Fernando
del Castillo began his collection with the poets
of the age of John II. He did not, however, take the
trouble to carry on the series in chronological order
through the fifteenth century. He places the spiritual
poems before the rest. He then gives the works of
several poets of the reign of John II. mingled with
others of more recent date, but so arranged, that the
productions of each author seem to be kept distinct.
After, however, the works are thus apparently given,
other poems follow under particular heads, partly by
the same and partly by different authors, whose names
are sometimes mentioned and sometimes not: there are
also a few Italian sonnets, and some coplas in the
Valencian language. In proportion as the collection
extended, the additions were always inserted at the
end of the book. In the oldest editions the number of
poets mentioned amounts to one hundred and thirty-six.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>A nation which can enumerate one hundred and
thirty-six song writers in a single century, and which
also possesses a great number of songs by unknown
authors, produced within the same period, may well
boast of its lyric genius; and the literary historian,
before he proceeds to a closer review of this collection,
may reasonably expect to find in it a full and true
representation of the national character. Thus the old
Spanish <i>Cancionero</i> is even more interesting to the
philosophic observer of human nature than to the
critic.</p>

<p>The Spiritual Songs, (<i>Obras de Devocion</i>,) at the
head of the collection, probably will not fulfil the expectations
which may be formed respecting them. It is
natural to presume that in a nation so poetically inclined,
and in an age when, for the most part, nature
was followed without reference to the rules of art, the
poets could not fail to view Christianity on its poetic
side. But the scholastic forms of the existing theology
crushed the genius of poetry; and the unpoetic side of
Christianity, because it was the most learned, was alone
deemed worthy the strains of the Spanish poets of the
fifteenth century. They likewise seldom ventured to
give scope to the fancy in devotional verses, because the
nation was accustomed to the most implicit faith in
every dogma of the church, and the recognition of the
sacredness of literal interpretation was identified with
orthodoxy, long before the terrors of the inquisition and
its burning piles were known. This rigid orthodoxy of
the Spanish Christians was a consequence of their war
of five hundred years duration with the Moors. Throughout
that long period the Spanish knight invariably fought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
for religion and his country; and from the constant hostility
that prevailed between the Christian and Mahometan
faiths, the Spanish Christians were wont to make a parade
of their creed, as the Christians of the east are accustomed
to do at the present day. Hence the strictest formality
was observed in all matters connected with religion;
and great as was the enthusiasm of the Spaniards
in the fifteenth century, it produced few, if any,
lyric compositions, containing more poetry than a common
hymn. Whether reference be made to the Twenty
Perfections of the Holy Virgin,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> (<i>Obra en loor de veinte
excellencias de nuestra Señora</i>), by Juan Tulante, who is
the author of most of the spiritual songs in the <i>Cancionero
general</i>; to the play on the five letters of the name <i>Maria</i>,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>
by the Visconde de Altamira; or to Fernan Perez
de Guzman’s versions of the <i>Ave Maria</i> and <i>Paternoster</i>,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>
which could not have been more dryly and formally
written in prose; we find in all the same monotony
without any poetic adaptation of the materials.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>The moral poems of this collection do not weigh
heavier in the scale of poetic merit. The art which the
ancients possessed of introducing moral ideas into the
region of poetry, was not attainable by the pupils of
the monastic schools. They allegorized either virtues
or vices according to the catalogue and definitions of
the scholastic philosophy; or they made common place
observations on human life, sometimes with declamatory
pomp, sometimes with real warmth of feeling, and occasionally
in agreeable verse, though destitute of any
poetic spirit. Gomez Manrique with commendable
frankness addressed a didactic poem on the Duties of
Sovereigns (<i>Regimiento de Principes</i>) in redondillas, to
Queen Isabella and her husband Ferdinand of Arragon;
but however valuable the truths which he wished to
impart to the royal pair, he could only express them in
versified prose.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> The moral coplas of his nephew
Jorge Manrique present somewhat stronger claims to
poetic merit; they were subsequently glossed as a
National Book of Devotion, and were held in high
estimation up to a recent period.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> In the moral as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
well as in the spiritual songs the character of the nation
is manifest. With equal warmth of feeling, with the
same disposition for light and sportive gaiety, the
Spaniards were invariably distinguished from the Italians
by moral gravity. Hence, they have in all times
set a high value on rules of conduct, sentences, and useful
proverbs, and have never regarded the principles
of genuine rectitude as less important than maxims of
worldly wisdom.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>But love songs form by far the principal part of the
contents of the old Spanish <i>Cancioneros</i>. To read
them regularly through, would require a strong passion
for compositions of this class, for the monotony of the
authors is interminable. To extend and spin out a
theme as long as possible, though only to seize a new
modification of the old ideas or phrases, was, in their
opinion, essential to the truth and sincerity of their
poetic effusions of the heart. That loquacity which is
an hereditary fault of the Italian Canzone, must also
be endured in perusing the amatory flights of the Spanish
redondillas, while in them the Italian correctness
of expression would be looked for in vain. From the
desire perhaps of relieving their monotony, by some
sort of variety the authors have indulged in even more
witticisms and plays of words than the Italians, but
they also sought to infuse a more emphatic spirit into
their compositions than the latter.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> The Spanish poems
of this class, exhibit, in general, all the poverty of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
compositions of the Troubadours, but blend with the
simplicity of these bards, the pomp of the Spanish national
style in its utmost vigour. This resemblance to
the Troubadour songs was not however produced by
imitation; it arose out of the spirit of romantic love,
which at that period, and for several preceding centuries,
gave to the south of Europe the same feelings
and taste. Since the age of Petrarch, this spirit had
appeared in classical perfection in Italy. But the
Spanish amatory poets of the fifteenth century had not
reached an equal degree of cultivation; and the whole
turn of their ideas required rather a passionate than a
tender expression. The sighs of the languishing Italians
became cries in Spain. Glowing passion, despair
and violent ecstacy, were the soul of the Spanish love
songs. The continually recurring picture of the contest
between reason and passion is a peculiar characteristic
of these songs. The Italian poets did not place so
much importance on the triumph of reason. The
rigidly moral Spaniard was, however, anxious to be
wise even in the midst of his folly. But this obtrusion
of wisdom in its improper place, frequently gives an
unpoetic harshness to the lyric poetry of Spain, in spite
of all the softness of its melody. It would be no unprofitable
or useless task to pursue this comparison still
further. But the limited extent of this work can
afford space for only a few notices and examples.</p>

<p>How successful the Spanish poets of the fifteenth
century were in gay and graceful love songs, when
guided only by their own feelings, is manifest from
some of the compositions of Juan de Mena; but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
charm vanishes the instant the poet begins to display
his skill and erudition.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> In a love song by Diego
Lopez de Haro, reason and the mind enter into a prolix
conversation on the value to be attached to affections
of the heart; and the thinking faculty admits reason at
the expense of poetry.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> In the other songs of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
same author, in which the mind obeys only the heart,
he is poetic in all the simplicity of passion, though in
search of wit he sometimes involves himself in obscure
subtilties.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> The fire of passion is excellently painted,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
even amidst sports of wit,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> in several songs by Alonzo
de Cartagena, afterwards archbishop of Burgos; and it
seems to rage incessantly in the love songs of Guivara,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
to one of which he has given the emphatic title of <i>El
Infierno de Amores</i>; or, The Hell of Love.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> Sanchez
de Badajoz, when, like a despairing lover, he wrote his
will in poetry, thought he might avail himself of some
passages from the book of Job to express his suffering.
He divided this strange kind of will into nine lessons,
(<i>leciones</i>). The ideas are very extravagant, but the execution
is vigorous, and in many parts not unpoetic.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
might be presumed that profane applications of the doctrines
and language of the bible would have given offence
to the Spanish public, or at least alarmed the guardians
of catholic orthodoxy. But such was not the case. Rodriguez
del Padron chose the Seven Joys of Love as the
subject of one of his songs, the title of which calls to
mind the Marquis of Santillana’s Joys of the Holy
Virgin; he also versified Love’s Ten Commandments,
(<i>Los diez Madamientos de Amor</i>.)</p>

<p>The other kinds of lyric poems, for example, the
laudatory poems, which are dispersed through the <i>Cancionero
general</i>, are not distinguished by any peculiar
features; but the poems under miscellaneous titles
in this collection deserve particular attention. They
exhibit the natural style, amalgamated with a conventional,
and thus form the model of a species of national
poetry, which has descended to the present age.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
Certain short lyric poems, usually called songs, (<i>canciones</i>,)
in the more strict sense of the term are
distinguished by a peculiar character and a decided
metrical form. They have always a sententious or an
epigramatic turn. The number of lines is generally
twelve, which are divided into two parts. The first
four lines comprehend the idea on which the song is
founded. And this idea is developed or applied in the
eight following lines. The <i>Cancionero general</i> contains
one hundred and fifty-six of these little songs, some of
which are the best poems in the whole book. For this
advantage they are probably indebted to their conventional
form, which confined the romantic verbosity
within narrow bounds. These little songs were to the
Spaniards of the fifteenth century, what the epigram
had been to the Greeks, and what the madrigal was
to the Italians and French. Like the latter, they
are generally devoted to some theme of gallantry; and
though they do not possess so high a polish, yet the
interest excited by the truth with which they paint the
character of the age, and their ingenious simplicity,
entitles them to be ranked among the sweetest blossoms
of the ancient spirit of romance.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>The Villancicos bear an immediate affinity to these
little songs. The idea which forms the subject of the
Villancico, is sometimes contained in two, but more
commonly in three lines. The developement, or application,
may be completed in one short stanza, but often
extends to several similar stanzas. These stanzas always
include seven lines. It was, perhaps, by way of irony
that the name Villancico was originally applied to
productions of this kind; for the spiritual motets,
which are sung during high mass on Christmas eve,
are also called Villancicos. At least no satisfactory
etymology has yet been found for the name. The
<i>Cancionero general</i> contains fifty-four Villancicos, and
among them are some which possess inimitable grace
and delicacy.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>These remarkable compositions, whose origin appears
to be lost in the early periods of the formation
of the Spanish language, doubtless gave rise to the
poetic gloss (<i>glosa</i>,) a kind of poem scarcely known,
even by name, on this side of the Pyrenees, but to
which the Spaniards and Portuguese of the fifteenth
century were particularly attached, and which subsequently
even after the introduction of the Italian forms,
continued to be preserved as national poetry in Spain
and Portugal.</p>

<p>The poetic glosses may, in some measure, be compared
to musical variations. The musician selects as
his theme some well known melody, which he paraphrases
or modifies into variations; in like manner in
Spain and Portugal, well known songs and romances
were paraphrased or modified into new productions, but
in such a manner that the original composition was,
without any alteration in the words, intertwined line
after line, at certain intervals into the new one. A
poem of this kind was called a gloss. By this operation
the connection of the glossed poem was broken, and the
comparison of the poetic glosses to musical variations is
therefore not in all respects exactly just. But the distinction
between them arises out of the different nature
of the arts of music and poetry; and it is indeed more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
surprising that these compositions have not flourished
beyond the boundaries of Spain and Portugal, than that
they should have been peculiar favourites in those two
countries. At first, the old romances were glossed;<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
then, as it appears, mottos, or sentiments, (<i>motes</i>,) in the
style of gallantry peculiar to the age,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> and, at length,
every thing that was capable of being glossed. There
is a particular class of <i>jeux d’esprit</i>, in the <i>Cancionero
general</i>, namely, versified questions and answers, and
versified interpretations of devices (<i>letras</i>,) which,
together with corresponding emblems, lords and ladies
drew by lot at festivals, tourneys, bull fights, &amp;c. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
these questions, answers, and devices, are in general
more whimsical than ingenious.</p>

<h3 id="OF_THE_ROMANCERO_GENERAL">OF THE ROMANCERO GENERAL.</h3>

<p>The latter half of the fifteenth century seems also
to have given birth to the greater portion of those
Spanish romances, which wrested the approbation of
criticism and public favour from the older productions
of the same class; and which, therefore, in the sequel,
formed the bulk of the <i>Romancero general</i>, or General
Romance Book. This Romancero of the Spaniards is so
closely related to their <i>Cancionero general</i>, that some
account of it may not be out of place here, though it
was not printed as a complete collection until the close
of the sixteenth century. With the exception of the
narrative romances, the Romancero may be considered
merely as a continuation of the Cancionero. The
poetry of the lyric pieces contained in it, which are
extremely numerous, is both in spirit and metrical form,
precisely the same as that which appears in the Cancionero,
but more polished in manner and language.
The title of romance indicates no essential difference.
The narrative romances, which occupy the greater
portion of the Romancero, have, in some measure, been
characterized in this history in treating of the old
romances of the same class; for most of them, particularly
those of the historical kind, differ little from the
more ancient. But a considerable portion of compositions
of every class have been contributed to the
Romancero by poets of the sixteenth century. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
collectors have mingled these romances and the older
ones together, without any attention to critical arrangement
or chronological order; and in no instance is there
any mention or indication of an author. In a history
of literature, it therefore becomes necessary to speak of
the Romancero as a whole; and for this purpose, the
present is perhaps the most convenient opportunity; for,
even at the period when this collection was produced,
the poets who wrote romances in the old national style,
merely improved that style without essentially altering it.</p>

<p>Among the historical romances, contained in the
Romancero, those in which anecdotes of the Moorish
war, or the heroic and gallant adventures of Moorish
knights, are poetically treated, seem, for the most part,
to belong to the latter half of the fifteenth century.
All these romances relate to the civil wars of Granada,
the last Moorish principality in Spain. The civil dissensions
of Castile retarded for upwards of half a
century the conquest of Granada, which was at length
effected in the year 1492, by the united power of
Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Arragon. During
this last period of the conflict between the Christians
and the Mahometans of Spain, the former became
more intimately acquainted with the history of the
latter. As the last blow for the deliverance of the
Peninsula was now about to be struck, all that related
to the Moors was doubly interesting to the Castilians.
The two rival factions, the Zegris and the Abencerrages,
whose mutual enmity accelerated the fall of
Granada, were, in a particular manner, the objects of
their adversaries attention.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>About this period it seems to have become a fashion
among the Spanish romance writers, to select from the
events of Moorish history, materials for their songs;
and in these romances the heroes of the Zegri and
Abencerrage tribes sustain the principal characters.
Even after the conquest of Granada, the interest excited
throughout Spain by that great national event,
still continued; and, doubtless, many romances, the
subjects of which are borrowed from Moorish history,
were produced in the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>The first Spanish pastoral romances, were probably
produced during the last ten years of the fifteenth
century. But no distinct traces exist of the rise of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
this species of poetry in Spain. In the poetry of the
age of John II. neither pastoral names nor ideas appear,
except in the satyrical poem, entitled, <i>Mingo Rebulgo</i>,
which will be hereafter noticed. Pastoral dramas are,
however, to be found in the works of Juan de la Enzina,
who flourished towards the close of the fifteenth century,
and of whom we shall also have occasion to speak
more at large. The Spanish pastoral poetry seems,
shortly after its rise, to have been blended with the
romantic poetry. Many of the most beautiful narrative
pieces in the <i>Romancero general</i> are properly pastoral
romances. It is quite impossible to ascertain correctly
to what age these bucolicks belong;<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> and it has,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
hitherto, proved equally impossible to obtain any positive
information respecting the origin of the facetious
and satyrical romances and songs, dispersed through
the <i>Romancero general</i>.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>Finally, the history of the <i>Romancero general</i>
itself still waits for bibliographic illustration; and in
order to throw any light on this subject, it would be
necessary to have the opportunity of examining the
Spanish libraries and old collections of manuscripts,
and to be able to bestow on them the most indefatigable
attention. Of all the collections, bearing the common
title of <i>Romancero general</i>, only two are quoted by
authors; one was edited by Miguel de Madrigal, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
year 1604; and the other by Pedro de Flores in 1614.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
Another publication, however, under the same title,
which also appeared in 1604, and which contains upwards
of a thousand romances and songs, professes to
be a new and augmented collection of this kind.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> At
what time, then, was the first collection made or published?</p>

<p>Those, however, who may think it unimportant to
enquire how many of these anonymous poems, which
have for ages delighted the Spanish public, were produced
in the fifteenth or sixteenth century, and who
may merely wish to see a selection of the best Spanish
poems in the old national style, have only to turn to
the <i>Romancero general</i>. Many of the narrative romances
which it contains, vie, in romantic simplicity,
with those of apparently older date in other collections,
and exceed them in elegance; and still more do a number
of the songs in the <i>Romancero</i> surpass those in the
<i>Cancionero general</i>. Thus the historian of literature
has additional cause to lament that through the absence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
of all chronological and bibliographical notices, he is
deprived of even the slight satisfaction of paying a just
tribute to the memory of the authors of the best of
these romances and songs, which really deserve to be
immortal. The poets themselves, it is true, do not
seem to have attached much value to fame. If their
songs, accompanied by the guitar, interested the hearts
and charmed the ears of their auditors, they sought no
laurels in addition to that true reward of the poet. Yet,
for this very reason, in an age when the lowest degree
of poetic merit presumptuously claims literary distinction,
the task would be the more pleasing to do honour
to those venerable authors, by raising the veil beneath
which their names have too long been concealed.</p>

<h3 id="FIRST_TRACES_OF_THE_ORIGIN">FIRST TRACES OF THE ORIGIN OF SPANISH DRAMATIC
POETRY IN THE MINGO REBULGO&mdash;JUAN
DEL ENZINA&mdash;CALLISTUS AND MELIBŒA, A
DRAMATIC TALE.</h3>

<p>All that now remains to be stated respecting the
poetic literature of the Spaniards during the fifteenth
century, must be comprehended in a notice of their
first essays in dramatic poetry.</p>

<p>In lieu of those poetic works which are styled dramatic
in the true sense of the word, and which afterwards
formed the most brilliant portion of Spanish
poetry, the Spaniards of the fifteenth century possessed
merely spiritual or temporal farces, written in the style
which prevailed in the middle ages, and which can
scarcely be said to belong to literature. At Saragossa,
the residence of the Court of Arragon, attempts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
towards the improvement of dramatic amusements were
earlier made than in the Castilian court. There, as
has already been observed, the Marquis de Villena
devoted his learning and inventive talents to the drama.
Allegorical dramas, indeed, do not seem to have been in
favour at the court of Castile, notwithstanding the
taste for allegory which distinguished the poets of the
reign of John II. A singular union of pastoral and
satirical poetry first gave birth to a species of dramatic
poem in the Castilian language.</p>

<p>In the reign of John II. an anonymous poet amused
himself by describing the court of that monarch in
satirical coplas. It is impossible to account for the
whim which induced him to throw his rhymes into the
form of a dialogue, and to select shepherds for his interlocutors.
The work extends to thirty-two coplas, and
critics have sometimes classed it among the eclogues,
and sometimes among the first satirical productions of
the Spanish poets. Some make Rodrigo de Cota the
author of these coplas; and others, who ascribe them
to Juan de Mena, seem to forget that the latter was
zealously devoted to the court party. This singular
composition is usually mentioned under the title of
Mingo Rebulgo, from the names of the two shepherds
who carry on the dialogue. Supposing pastoral poetry
to have been in vogue at that period in Spain, and particularly
at the court of John II. it would be easy to explain
how a witty author might conceive the bold idea of
converting a pastoral dialogue into a satire; but in that
case the ideas of a poetic pastoral existence must have
been diffused through Spain, as they were through Italy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
It is probable, however, that in both countries the revived
study of classical literature, and particularly of
Virgil’s eclogues, gave rise to the practice of clothing
modern ideas in a garb imitated from the ancient bucolic
poetry; and it seems the effect of mere accident
that a Spaniard should have been the first to devote a
work of this kind to the purposes of satire.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>Doubtless neither the eclogue of Mingo Rebulgo,
nor the colloquial stanzas in the <i>Cancionero</i> can properly
be regarded as the commencement of dramatic
poetry in Spain. But all these preliminary essays in
dialogue, are in a literary point of view connected together;
and about the close of the fifteenth century,
pastoral dialogues were converted into real dramas,
by a musical composer, named Juan de la Enzina, or
del Enzina, as he is styled in the old collections of
his works. This ingenious man who was born in Salamanca
during the reign of Queen Isabella, though in
what year is not precisely known, was equally celebrated
as a poet and musician. He travelled to Jerusalem
in company with the Marquis de Tarifa, and
this journey could not fail to store his mind with many
new ideas. He lived for some time at Rome in the
quality of chapel-master, or musical director to Pope
Leo; who, it is well known, afforded great encouragement
to dramatic amusements. But at Rome, as well
as in Palestine, Juan de la Enzina still remained
a Spaniard. His poetry imbibed no tincture of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Italian taste, and he continued to write songs and lyric
romances in the old Castilian style. He also exercised
his fancy in making jests, consisting of ridiculous combinations
or heterogeneous conceits, called <i>disparates</i>,
which he wrote in the form of romances. For instance,
he talks with an absurd but harmless humour of a
“cloud which at night, at day break in the afternoon
arrived from a pilgrimage, having in its train a domestic
utensil which appeared in <i>pontificalibus</i>,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> These
oddities rendered his name a proverb in Spain. He
converted Virgil’s eclogues into romances, in which he
displayed singular simplicity, and applied to his patrons,
Ferdinand and Isabella, the duke and duchess of Alba,
and others, the compliments which Virgil addressed to
the emperor Augustus. Accident had introduced into
Spain a mixture of pastoral poetry with the drama, and
Juan de la Enzina wrote sacred and profane eclogues,
in the form of dialogues, which were represented before
distinguished audiences on Christmas eve, during the
carnival, and on other festivals. They are, however,
entirely lost to literature.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>The dramatic romance of <i>Callistus</i> and <i>Melibœa</i>
is, however, more celebrated than Juan de la Enzina’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
eclogues. It was probably commenced in the reign of
Ferdinand and Isabella; though some authors assign
this singular production of popular descriptive talent and
well meant plainness to the age of John II. The author
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
is supposed to be Rodrigo de Cota, to whom the pastoral
dialogue of Mingo Rebulgo is also attributed.
This dramatic romance was continued and completed
at the commencement of the fifteenth century by Fernando
de Roxas, who has recorded his own name in
the initials of the introductory stanzas.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> Fernando de
Roxas did not possess the forcible descriptive powers of
the unknown author, though he appears to have fully
entered into the plan traced out by the latter. Either
he or his precursor entitled the work a tragi-comedy.
It consists of twenty-one acts, and consequently its vast
length renders it unfit for theatrical representation.
This production may be regarded as original in a certain
sense, for there existed no work of the same kind
which the author could have chosen as his model.
But in a higher and truly critical point of view, it
possesses as little originality as real poetic merit. Natural
description and moral precept seem to have formed
the great object of both authors. They both aimed
at exhibiting a series of dramatic lessons to warn youth
against the seductive arts of base agents employed to promote
intrigues. In order to attain this moral end, the
authors deemed it necessary to paint in glowing colours
the disgusting picture of a brothel, and through a series
of scenes unconnected by the unities of time or place,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
to exhibit in the most striking point of view, the tragical
end of an intrigue conducted by a woman of infamous
character. Owing to its moral object, the book
has found admirers in all ages, though many have not
unreasonably conceived it more advisable to withdraw
such scenes of vice from the eye of youth, than to paint
them with the minuteness and vivid colouring of truth.
But, even allowing that an inconsiderate young person
may have occasionally been deterred from an intrigue
by the sad history of Callistus and Melibœa, yet the
whole dramatic tale, both in the subject and execution,
is nevertheless revolting to good taste. The story is
as follows:&mdash;Callistus, a young man of noble family,
entertains a romantic passion for Melibœa. The young
lady is also attached to him; but her own prudence, as
well as the strict observation to which she is subject in
the house of her parents, prevents all communication
between the lovers. In this difficulty, Callistus applies
to an artful and abandoned woman, to whom the author
has given the elegant name of Celestina. She easily
devises a pretence for insinuating herself into the house
of Melibœa’s parents, where she succeeds in bribing the
servants. The intrigue then proceeds in the most common
manner, though the author thinks it necessary to
call in the aid of witchcraft and magic. Callistus at
length attains his object, and Melibœa’s parents discover
the mischief when it is too late. Murder is committed
among the servants of Melibœa; Celestina’s house likewise
becomes the scene of bloodshed; the profligate
woman is herself murdered in the most horrible manner
imaginable; Callistus is assassinated, and Melibœa closes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
the tragedy by throwing herself from the top of a lofty
tower. Such is the ground-work of the twenty-one
acts of this tragi-comedy. It must be admitted, that
the authors appear to have wished to paint the scenes
in the house of Celestina in as decorous a manner as
the nature of the subject would permit. The profligate
personages, particularly Celestina, are drawn with great
truth; and in the list of the characters their description
is unreservedly added to their names. The first act,
which is by the unknown author, is distinguished above
the rest for the easy flow of the dialogue.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> Considered
in this point of view alone, the work is extremely interesting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
It affords a fair proof that the fluent and
natural style of conversation which the dramatic poets
of the north did not attain, until after much labour and
repeated failures, arose spontaneously in Spain, on the
first attempt made by a writer of talent to make dramatic
characters speak in prose.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> This tragi-comedy,
as it is styled, has, however, but little relation to poetry.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<h3 id="FURTHER_ACCOUNT_OF_SPANISH_PROSE">FURTHER ACCOUNT OF SPANISH PROSE.<br />

<span class="medium">RISE OF THE HISTORICAL ART&mdash;EARLY PROGRESS
OF THE EPISTOLARY STYLE.</span></h3>

<p>In a history of Spanish prose of the fifteenth century,
it would be improper to omit a brief notice of
the chronicles, which, in Spain, at this period, were
not written by monks, as in other parts of Europe, but
by knights, many of whom were at the same time
poets. The custom instituted by Alphonso X. of appointing
historiographers to record the most remarkable
events of national history, was maintained by his successors
throughout the fourteenth century; and, in addition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
to those historians, who were regularly appointed
and paid, there arose others in the fifteenth century,
who wrote of their own accord from the love of fame,
or for the sake of doing honour to the parties to which
they were respectively attached. Historians were never
held in such high estimation in modern Europe as they
were at this time in Castile.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the fortunate circumstances
which combined to revive the taste for historical composition
in Spain, the noble authors of the Spanish
chronicles in very few instances rose above the vulgar
chronicle style. They faithfully adhered to the language
of the historical books of the bible. In nothing is their
poetic talent disclosed, except in a better choice of expression,
than is to be found in the common chronicles,
which were in general written by monks. Spirited and
adequate historical description was totally unknown to
them. They all wrote in nearly the same manner. Facts
were heaped on facts, in long monotonous sentences,
which uniformly commenced with the conjunction <i>and</i>.
Occasionally, indeed, the writers of these chronicles
seem to have made attempts to imitate the ancient
historians; for at every favourable opportunity little
speeches are put into the mouths of the characters they
record; but these speeches are given either in the language
of scripture or the law. Thus wrote the illustrious
Perez de Guzman, who was celebrated among
the poets of his age; and thus wrote the grand
Chancellor of Castile, Pedro Lopez de Ayala, who is
better known than the former as an historian, in consequence
of having compiled from ancient chronicles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
a connected history of the kings of Castile of the fourteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>An agreeable surprise is, however, excited in discovering
among these chronicles some biographical
works, one of which was probably written in the last
years of the fourteenth century, and another, doubtless,
belongs to the fifteenth. These two productions deserve
to be noticed, but in a rhetorical point of view
neither can be very highly estimated. The first is the
history of Count Pedro Niño de Buelna, one of the
bravest knights of the reign of Henry III. The author
is Gutierre Diez de Games, who was the Count’s standard-bearer.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
The gothic taste of the age, it must be
confessed, is sufficiently apparent in this history. The
chivalrous author begins by apostrophizing the Trinity
and the Holy Virgin. He then reasons methodically
on virtue and vice, according to the scholastic notions
of morality. It is, however, easy to perceive that the
author has taken great pains to avoid the dry chronicle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
style. He evidently wished to give to the history of
his hero the interest of a romance. He did not, therefore,
confine himself very scrupulously to historical truth,
and he has even blended fabulous stories in his narrative.
But on the other hand he paints real events with
a degree of spirit of which no example is to be found
in the chronicles; and some of his descriptions are so
remarkable for precision, and accuracy of expression,
that they might be mistaken for the production of a
modern writer, if the simplicity of the ideas did not
betray the age to which the chivalrous author belonged.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>The second of these biographical works is the history
of Count Alvaro de Luna. The author, whose
name is not known, appears to have been in the Count’s
service, and to have taken up the pen soon after the
execution of that extraordinary man, to raise a monument
to his memory in defiance of his enemies.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
work is in fact an apology, in which the enthusiasm of
the anonymous author for his hero carries him beyond
the bounds of historical calmness and of impartiality.
But this very enthusiasm gives the work a degree of
rhetorical interest, which is wanting in the chronicles.
Alvaro de Luna is regarded by his apologist in his real
character; namely, as the greatest, if not the most disinterested
man of his age in Spain: and it was the
author’s intention that the animated picture he drew
should mortify and shame the powerful party which
overthrew his hero. His zeal frequently betrays him
into declamatory pomp. But what other Spanish writer
of that age could declaim with so much eloquence.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>
He is not, however, always declamatory. His introduction,
notwithstanding the high elevation of the ideas,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
possesses real dignity of expression, combined with the
true harmony of prose.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> His apostrophe to truth at the
close of this introduction, is a genuine overflowing of
the heart.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> It is true that the narrative itself somewhat
inclines to the manner of the chronicles; but the
spirit which pervades the whole work is perceptible even
in the style which, considered with reference to the
period in which it was written, is remarkable for precision
and facility.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> In short, this biographical chronicle,
estimated by its rhetorical merit, has, in spite of all its
gothic ornaments and declamatory excrescences, no parallel
among the chronicles of the age to which it belongs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p><i>Los Claros Varones</i>, the Celebrated Men, is a work
which claims particular attention. The author is Fernando
del Pulgar, who filled the office of historiographer
in the reign of Isabella and Ferdinand. This ingenious
man was ambitious to be thought the Plutarch of his
nation. In his twenty-six short biographical sketches, he
has, however, confined himself within limits too narrow
to effect all that he was capable of; but the precision
of his descriptions, and the purity of his style, are nevertheless
remarkable for the age in which he flourished.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>Fernando del Pulgar is also the oldest Castilian author
in the epistolary style; and upon the whole he may be
regarded as the first, who, in the character of a statesman
and public functionary, formed his correspondence in a
modern language on the model of Cicero and Pliny.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>Those who have time and opportunity to peruse
Spanish manuscripts of the fifteenth century, will doubtless
find many more documents to prove the high degree
of cultivation which Spanish prose had attained at that
period. In spite of the lofty poetic flight which then
characterized the genius of Spain, and the powerful
charm of the poetic prose of the chivalrous romances,
the national gravity of the Spaniards, when their minds
were directed, not to sports of the imagination, but
to things, made them incline to what may be termed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
the style of affairs, in the same degree as the genius of
the Italians, which attached itself exclusively to beautiful
forms, had been accustomed to manifest an indifference
for true prose. The philosophic writings of
Aristotle were, in the same age, translated into Spanish
by a scholar, whose name, as well as his work, have
fallen into oblivion.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<h3 id="JUAN_DE_LA_ENZINAS_ART_OF_CASTILIAN_POETRY">JUAN DE LA ENZINA’S ART OF CASTILIAN POETRY.</h3>

<p>The literature of this period possesses, however, not
the slightest trace of true criticism. Though the poetical
and rhetorical rules of Aristotle were known to a
few scholars, they were of little utility to writers who
either applied them erroneously, or considered them
impracticable. Of the state of poetry in Spain, during
the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, a correct notion
may be formed from a Treatise on Castilian Poetry,
(<i>Arte de Poesia Castellana</i>,) by Juan de la Enzina.
In this work, addressed to the Prince Royal of Spain,
the author wished to prove that he thoroughly understood
the art on which he wrote, and that he was not
an unskilful Troubadour.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> The commencement of the
treatise might teach the reader to expect some profound
investigation. Juan de la Enzina observes, “that
poetry is so excellent an art, that it merits the particular
favour of princes and nobles”, who being reared “in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
bosom of sweet philosophy,”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> know how to unite the
virtues both of peace and war; it was therefore, he
continues, his intention to write a theory (<i>arte</i>) of
Castilian poetry, which might facilitate the distinction
between good and bad. He treats of the origin of
poetry among the ancients and among the Italians, and
marks the difference between a poet and a Troubadour.
The former, he says, is, with respect to the latter,
“what a composer or learned musician is to a singer
or musical performer, a geometrician to a mason, or
a captain to a private soldier.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> After all these high
promises, Juan de la Enzina merely gives an Essay on
Castilian prosody in a few chapters. Such is his art
of poetry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus did Castilian poetry and eloquence develope
itself in the ancient national forms, during the first
centuries that succeeded its birth, without any superior
genius having either raised it to higher perfection, or
enlarged its boundaries. Like the <i>Gaya Ciencia</i> of
the Troubadours, it was a common property, protected
by a literary democracy, which allowed no despotic
genius to encroach upon its rights. It is difficult to
imagine what might have been the fate of Castilian
poetry, had not a new political connection formed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
between Spain and Italy, at the commencement of the
sixteenth century, suddenly brought the Spanish nation,
as it were in mass, in contact with the Italians. At
all events, the Spaniards must, in the progress of cultivation,
have ceased to be satisfied with the poetry of
their old songs and romances, on their literary taste
becoming in any way more refined.

<span id="GENERAL_VIEW_OF_THE_STATE" class="medium">GENERAL VIEW OF THE STATE OF POETICAL AND
RHETORICAL CULTIVATION IN SPAIN DURING
THE ABOVE PERIOD.</span></h3>

<p>The union of the kingdoms of Castile and Arragon,
in consequence of the marriage of Isabella, the heiress
of the Castilian throne, with Ferdinand king of Arragon,
forms an epoch in Spanish literature, as well as in
Spanish power. Hitherto Spain had been occupied only
with her own internal affairs. The monarchs contended
for their prerogatives with the powerful barons of their
respective states; and the two kingdoms waged war
against each other. The only object which they pursued
in common, was the overthrow of the Moorish principality
of Granada, which was enabled to resist them, as
long as their political jealousy of each other counter-balanced
their mutual zeal for religion and conquest.
Spain, in her detached situation to the west of the
Pyrenees, never appeared so completely separated from
the rest of Europe as in the middle of the fifteenth
century. With Italy, Spain maintained no relations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
except such as were purely ecclesiastical. A marked
change, however, took place on the union of the crowns
of Castile and Arragon, though the union of the two
monarchies was not properly consolidated until after
Ferdinand’s death, which happened in 1516. Since the
year 1492, Granada had been a Castilian province. The
poets had no longer the feats of the Zegris and Abencerrages
to record; and the Spanish knights had no
infidels to vanquish, unless they travelled to Africa in
quest of them. If, however, they were successful in
that quarter of the world, their victories did not present
subjects of such interest to the Castilian muse as
former achievements had afforded. The love of industry
and social order, which distinguished the people
of Arragon, at length extended to Castile; and the old
chivalrous spirit declined in proportion as the use of
gunpowder, which was at this period rapidly increasing,
became more general. The manners of the Spaniards
of both monarchies, had now approximated to those of
the Italians; and the analogy between the Castilian and
Italian languages, could not fail to be remarked, whenever
opportunities for making that observation occurred.
Ferdinand soon afforded such an opportunity; his ambition
induced him to take an active part in the transactions
of Italy, and his interference was attended
with success. The victorious Gonsalvo Fernandez de
Cordova, admired as the conqueror of Granada, and a
second Cid, and surnamed, by way of distinction, <i>El
gran Capitan</i>, presented the crown of Naples to his
sovereign in the year 1504. The political union which
then took place between Spain and Italy, and which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
continued longer than a century, paved the way for
that influence of the Italian poetry on the Spanish,
which soon after became manifest.</p>

<p>About the same period that Ferdinand and Isabella
united their dominions, they also co-operated in the
establishment of that terrible tribunal which soon became
known throughout Europe by the name of the
Spanish Inquisition, and which to the disgrace of human
reason exercised during two centuries and a half
its monstrous powers in their fullest extent. A crafty
policy contrived to render religion its instrument, in
subjugating to one common tyranny the reason and the
rights of mankind; for the establishment of regal despotism
in both kingdoms was the great object of this
institution, and its whole organization corresponded
with the end for which it was destined. The pope,
who penetrated the design of the founders, viewed
their proceedings with much dissatisfaction; but even
the pope was obliged to support the pretended interest
of the church, and to honour Ferdinand by bestowing
on him, as a peculiar distinction, the title of “Catholic
King.” Thus the court of Rome contributed to annul
the privileges of the Cortes of Castile and Arragon, and
to invest the whole powers of government, without limitation,
in the hands of an absolute monarch: and thus
did political artifice triumph over the energy of one of
the noblest nations in the world, at the very moment
when the genius of that nation had begun to expand,
when the promising flower had burst forth from the
bud, and was about to unfold itself in full vigour and
beauty. A simultaneous and concordant cultivation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
the different powers of the human mind was now as
little to be hoped for in Spain as the improvement of
her political constitution. Under these circumstances
the literary genius of the country could not be expected
to reach that high maturity of taste which always presupposes
a certain degree of harmony in the moral and
intellectual faculties. Poetic freedom was circumscribed
by the same shackles which fettered moral liberty.
Thoughts which could not be expressed without fear of
the dungeon and the stake, were no longer materials for
the poet to work on. His imagination instead of improving
them into poetic ideas, and embodying them
in beautiful verse, had to be taught to reject them. But
the eloquence of prose was more completely bowed
down under the inquisitorial yoke than poetry, because
it was more closely allied to truth, which, of all things,
was the most dreaded.</p>

<p>The yoke of this odious tribunal weighed, however,
far less heavily on the imagination than on the other
faculties of the mind; and it must be confessed that a
wide field still remained open for the range of fancy,
though the boundaries of religious doctrine were not
permitted to be overstepped. To suppose that the
Spanish inquisition could have entirely annihilated the
poetic genius of the nation, it must also be supposed,
that at the period of its establishment, there had existed
a style of poetry altogether hostile to such an
institution, and that the spirit of the inquisition was
directly opposed to the spirit of the nation. But it
would be forming a false notion of the horrors of the
inquisition, to imagine that they were ever felt in Spain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
in the same manner as in other countries, and particularly
in the Netherlands, where that tribunal was
introduced hand in hand with foreign despotism. When
the inquisition was established in Spain, it harmonized
to all appearance, that is to say, as far as orthodox
faith was concerned, with the prevailing opinions of the
Spanish Christians. It was ostensibly directed not so
much against heretics as against infidels, namely, Mahometans
and Jews. Its operations were accordingly
commenced by waging war against those infidels, for
no sect of Christian heretics existed at that period in
Spain, and the inquisition took care that none should
be afterwards formed. To maintain the purity of the
ancient faith was the avowed object of the inquisition;
and its wrath was poured out on the unfortunate Jews,
Moors, and Moriscos, (the descendants of the Moors),
with the view of removing every blemish from the
faith of a nation, which prided itself in its orthodoxy.
This bigotted pride was a consequence of the contest
maintained in Spain during four centuries and a half,
between Catholic Christianity and Mahometanism. The
Spanish Christians celebrated the conquest of Granada
as the triumph of the church; and the inquisition, which
at first excited terror, soon became an object of veneration
with men in whose hearts religious enthusiasm
was inseparably blended with patriotism.</p>

<p>This view of the subject may serve to explain how
it happened in the sequel, and particularly during the
reign of Philip II. that while, throughout all the rest
of Europe men shuddered at the very name of the
Spanish inquisition, the Spaniards still lived under it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
as happily and cheerfully as ever; and also how, from the
operation of the same cause, the ecclesiastical shackles
had not a more injurious effect on the developement of
the poetic genius of the nation. The conduct of the inquisition
was no subject of alarm to those who were confident
that they never could have any personal concern
with it; for the suspicion of deficiency in Catholic orthodoxy,
the ground on which that tribunal acted, was
more degrading in Spain than the most odious crimes
in other countries. Before the establishment of the
inquisition, fanaticism was so firmly rooted in the minds
of the Spaniards, that all scepticism in matters of religion
was abhorred as a deadly sin. He, however, who
submitted with blind devotion to the decrees of the
church, was held to have a clear conscience, and in that
sort of clear conscience the Spaniards prided themselves.
The inquisition disturbed the good Catholic as little in
his social enjoyments, as criminal justice the citizen who
lived in conformity with the laws. The Spaniard was
cruel only to heretics and infidels, because he thought
it his duty to hate them; but in the orthodox bosom of
his native country, he was animated by a spirit of gaiety
of which the literature of Spain presents abundant
proofs. While the Duke of Alba in the Netherlands
ruled with the axe of the executioner, Cervantes, in
Spain, wrote his Don Quixote, and Lope de Vega, who
himself held a post connected with the inquisition, produced
his admirable comedies. The dramatic literature
of Spain flourished with most brilliancy during
the reigns of the three Philips, from 1556 to 1665,
and that is precisely the period when the Spanish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
inquisition exercised its power with the greatest rigour
and the most sanguinary cruelty. Many melancholy
traces of fanaticism are certainly observable in the literature
of Spain during the reigns of the three Philips;
but those traces are so insulated, and the painful impression
which they naturally produce on liberal minds
is so far compensated, by the noblest traits of humanity,
that to him, who, from reading the works of the Spanish
poets, should turn to the perusal of the political history
of the Spaniards during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, and particularly to the history of their transactions
in the Netherlands and America, it might well
appear that he had become acquainted with two distinct
nations.</p>

<p>Indeed, notwithstanding the generally prejudicial
effects of the restrictions imposed by the inquisition on
intellectual freedom, those restrictions could not fail,
under the circumstances which have been described, to
prove in one respect favourable to the polite literature of
Spain. The poetic genius which, at the period of the
establishment of this tribunal, was energetically developing
itself throughout the Peninsula, was not now to be
annihilated. Its strength was even augmented by that
growing national pride, which the union of the Castilian
and Arragonian monarchies fostered. During
the period marked by the reign of Charles I. better
known by his Germanic imperial title of Charles V.
which was nearly half a century, namely, from the year
1516 to the year 1555, the Austrian and Spanish monarchies
were also united, and Spain acquired rich possessions
in a new quarter of the world. The Spanish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
arms were not so victorious under the three Philips as
under Charles V. But, sacrificed as this gallant nation
was to fanaticism and the most despicable of governments,
its spirit never sunk under disaster, and its
genius vented itself in the cultivation of poetry, because
it was excluded by religious despotism from every
graver study, except the scholastic philosophy of the
convent. It is also to be considered, that the influence
of the ever debasing despotism of the Spanish government
could operate only gradually in extinguishing the
energies of national genius. The bold manifestation of
the spirit of freedom in Castile and Arragon on the
accession of Charles V. was attended with discouraging
results, because the nobility and the third estate did not
unite in support of their common interests. Had that
union existed, Spain would probably have presented
the first model of a constitutional, and at the same time
a vigorous monarchy. That honour was withheld by
fate: but the genius of the Spanish people was not so
easily suppressed as their political and religious freedom.
Kings might rule as they pleased; they might
madly shed the blood of their subjects, or waste the
treasures drawn from America; but the people, who had
yielded to despotism only for the sake of religion, continued
in their hearts to be what they had always
been, till the influence of time consummated their subjugation.
The Spanish patriot, who fought in the cause
of his king and country, was until then, in his own estimation,
still a free man. Kings received homage in
verse as well as in prose; but a court poetry, like that
which existed in France in the reign of Lewis XIV.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
was never known in Spain. The kings of Spain, too,
never bestowed any very liberal encouragement on the
poetic literature of their country. Charles V. honoured
a few Spanish and Italian poets with some degree of
attention, according to the fashion of the princes of that
age; for in the sixteenth century a poet was accounted
an extremely useful man for business of every sort;
but that sovereign seems to have taken a more particular
interest in Italian than in Spanish literature.
Philip II. from his joyless throne, occasionally cast a
glance of favour on a man of talent; but restless ambition
and blind bigotry occupied his gloomy mind, and
deprived him of all susceptibility for the beautiful. His
son, Philip III. though of a more amiable character, was
too indolent to take a warm interest in any thing whatever.
Philip IV. however, did more for Spanish literature
than any of his predecessors since the time of John II.
His taste for pomp and splendour, to which he thoughtlessly
gave himself up, while decay and disorder preyed
upon the vitals of the state, disposed him to favour the
Spanish theatre. Calderon, whom he pensioned, was
indebted to him for that leisure which enabled him to
devote his life to dramatic poetry. But Calderon only
improved on the labours of predecessors, who, without
receiving the pay of kings, produced works which did
honour to the nation, and were approved and rewarded
by the public. Spanish literature owes nothing to kings,
and has to thank only the popular spirit for all its
brightest flowers. The drama, therefore, remained
wholly national, even after the imitation of Italian
forms had long prevailed in the lyric and epic poetry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
of Spain. Writers for the stage must of necessity obey
the voice of a public possessing sufficient energy of character
to condemn every piece which does not pay
homage to the popular taste. The whole history of the
Spanish theatre exhibits this dominion of the public
over authors; and the particular taste of the dramatists
being formed under the influence of the general poetic
genius of the nation, they very willingly, like Lope de
Vega, followed the stream, even though, like him, they
well knew what the true theory of their art required.
The cultivation of prose was more completely left to
the individual taste of the authors; but any instance of
encouragement from the throne was as uncommon with
respect to it as to poetry. Antonio de Solis, who received
a pension from Philip IV. as historiographer, for
writing the History of Spanish America, was indebted
for that honour in some measure to his reputation as a
poet, and his various acquirements, but by no means for
any particular esteem he had obtained on account of
his talent for prose composition.</p>

<p>During the whole of this period, however, intellectual
talents were never undervalued, either by the
kings, or the nobles of Spain. In that country, as well
as in Italy, the higher orders considered it a duty to seek
distinction through learning, and poetry was the soul
both of Spanish and Italian literature. Most of the
Spanish poets of this period, if not of noble birth,
belonged, at least, to families of consideration. Heroes,
statesmen, ecclesiastics, all composed verses, and poetry
was most intimately interwoven with all the relations of
social life. No where did chivalrous gallantry so long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
survive the extinction of real chivalry as in Spain;
and poetry was the exhaustless language of that gallantry,
whether it displayed itself in secret love intrigues,
or at public entertainments and festivals. Every
characteristic national amusement, as for instance, a
bull fight, proved an incitement to the writing of
sonnets and romances. There are found in various
Spanish poems of this period many expressions and
allusions which have reference to popular amusements,
but the poetic sense of which is only intelligible to
readers who bear in their recollection the favourite
diversions of the nation. The romantic intrigues
which were common in high life, formed models for
the intricate plots of the Spanish comedies; but no
ordinary powers of invention were necessary to enable
the dramatic author to maintain on the stage a competition
with the scenes which actually occurred in
society. Throughout the whole country, singing and
dancing were essential ingredients in every amusement.
Learned musical composition had, at this time, little
attraction for the Spaniards; but wherever joy was,
musicians were not wanting, and every dance had its
song.</p>

<p>In the mean time the cultivation of the other fine
arts, afforded little aid to Spanish poetry, as the overwhelming
interest attached to it in its golden age
directed the intellectual energies of the nation almost
exclusively to that one object. All other liberal pursuits
were consequently left far behind.</p>

<p>Spanish taste was, at this period, entirely left to
form itself, being abandoned to the influence of Italian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
literature, and the authority of eminent national authors.
The Italian system of academies found little
favour in Spain. Perhaps the jealousy of the inquisition
foreboded evil from meetings of men of letters.
Be this as it may, Spanish literature sustained little
loss by the want of those institutions. The Royal
Academy for the Spanish language and literature was
not established until the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The intimate union, which, during the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, subsisted between the eloquence
of prose and poetry in Spain, renders a separate
history of each unnecessary. A division may, however,
be advantageously made in the whole body of the
Spanish literature of this period, though the two sections
cannot form two distinct epochs. From the
introduction of the Italian style into Spanish poetry,
until the decline of learning in the latter years of the
reign of Philip IV. no literary revolution was experienced
in Spain. The <i>corrupters of taste</i>, as certain
writers who appeared in the latter half of this
period are called by some of the Spanish critics, only
continued a movement, the impulse of which had
been given long before by various authors, and particularly
by the dramatic poets. Several of these
writers were contemporaries with authors who placed
a high value on classical correctness, and yet they
exercised a much greater influence over the general
literature of Spain than the latter. To confound Calderon,
who perfected the Spanish comedy, according
to its true national character, with the corrupters of
taste, is an idea which could only have been entertained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
in the eighteenth century, when it became customary
in Spain, as every where else, to measure all productions
of genius by the rules of French criticism. But at
the same time, that Spanish poetry approximated as
closely to the Italian, as the necessary connection of
the former with the national style would permit, that
national style, with all its faults and beauties, still
maintained the pre-eminence; and the passion for Italian
correctness again declined. This crisis in Spanish
literature, occasioned by the struggle between Italian
refinement and the bold eccentricity of the national
manners, occurred in the age of Cervantes. At that
time Lope de Vega shone with more brilliancy in the
eyes of his countrymen than Cervantes, and the party
of the former gained the victory and kept the field.
The taking of a distinct view of the progress of poetry
and eloquence in Spain, will therefore be facilitated, if
the period of the influence of Cervantes and Lope de
Vega be made an historical resting point. It is doubtless
very remarkable, that Cervantes, who created an epoch
in the general literature of Europe, should not have
produced sufficient effect on the Literature of his own
country, to justify the choosing him as the founder of
a new epoch in its literary history. An opportunity
will hereafter arise for reverting to this subject.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>

<h3 id="OCCASION_OF_THE_INTRODUCTION_OF_THE_ITALIAN_STYLE">OCCASION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ITALIAN
STYLE.</h3>

<p>After the complete consolidation of the monarchies
of Castile and Arragon by the accession of Charles of
Austria, the grandson of Isabella and Ferdinand, there
appears to have been, for a short time, a suspension of
all literary activity in Spain. The political convulsions
which then agitated the interior of the two united kingdoms,
occupied the public mind too powerfully to allow
any interest to be felt in calmer and more agreeable
objects. But as soon as the civil contests were terminated
by the success of the Austrian party, and the
enterprising Charles, incited by Francis I. employed
the force of his Spanish states to win new dominions in
Italy, the poetic genius of Spain revived in all its pristine
vigour. In the meantime, the ancient dialect of
the Arragonian provinces began to be supplanted by
the Castilian, which became the language of the state
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
and of public business throughout Spain. Castile was
then considered the heart of the whole monarchy. Madrid
rose to the rank of the capital of Spain, and Saragossa
sunk into the condition of a provincial town.
It was therefore no very extraordinary event, that a
Catalonian, whose maternal language still possessed
a certain degree of poetic consideration, should, in connection
with a Castilian, produce a revolution in Castilian
poetry.</p>

<h3 id="BOSCAN">BOSCAN.</h3>

<p>Juan Boscan Almogavèr, who, in concert with his
friend Garcilaso de la Vega, introduced the Italian style
into Castilian poetry, was born in Barcelona, towards
the close of the fifteenth century. He belonged to one
of the Patrician families of that city, of equal rank
with the nobility of the country. Though possessing a
liberal education, and sufficient fortune to enable him to
gratify his inclination for literary studies, without regard
to any secondary views, he embarked, notwithstanding,
on his first outset in life for a short period in the profession
of arms. He afterwards travelled, but the countries
he visited are not mentioned in the brief notices
which remain of him. If, however, it be supposed that
he went at this time to Italy, and rendered himself intimately
acquainted with the literature of that country, it
appears that he was still far from entertaining the idea
of transplanting the forms and manner of Italian poetry
into Spain; for the Castilian verses, which he wrote
in his youth, were all in the ancient lyric style, which,
since the time of Juan de Mena no one had thought it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
necessary to try to improve. It was not until 1526,
when, after having flourished at the court of Charles V.
he had made a happy marriage, and was settled in his
native city, that a Venetian induced him to imitate the
Italian poetry in the Castilian language. The emperor
resided for some time in Granada; and, among the
foreign ministers who repaired to his court, was Andrea
Navagero, the envoy from Venice, a man of great literary
and historical knowledge, and, like every well-educated
Italian of that age, a writer of canzoni and sonnets.
Boscan, having formed an intimate friendship with this
minister, was taught by him to view the Italian poetry
and also the classical latin in quite a new light. The
Spanish lyric poetry, which with all its gothic excrescences
was still pleasing to the nation, if not so barbarous
in his eyes as in those of his Italian friend,
appeared to him, when compared with a sonnet of
Petrarch, at least, in the point of good taste greatly
inferior. He now readily perceived the nature and felt
the value of the precision and correctness of the great
works of antiquity. Animated by his new ideas, he fearlessly
ventured to follow the counsel of Navagero, in
spite of the menacing clamour of the friends of the old
national forms. He took upon himself the character of
a reformer of the lyric poetry of his nation, and commenced
his labours by writing sonnets in the manner of
Petrarch.</p>

<p>The metrical structure of the sonnet had long been
known in Spain;<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> but the genius of Castilian poetry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
was adverse to that form, and the Spaniards had manifested
very little predilection for any thing like the
elegant correctness of Petrarch. Boscan had therefore
elevated himself above the literature of his country,
when he perceived that it was necessary to infuse a
new spirit into Castilian poetry before it could be reconciled
to the Italian forms. His friend Garcilaso de la
Vega participated in this opinion. But thousands of
voices were raised against the reformers. Some insisted
that preference was to be given to the old Castilian verse
on the ground of euphony. Others went further, and
asserted that the ear could perceive no distinction between
the new verse and prose. Finally, a third party
discovered that Italian poetry was effeminate, and was
fit only for Italians and women. Boscan relates that
this violent opposition made him reflect seriously on the
propriety of proceeding with his design; but as he was
soon convinced of the futility of the reasons urged
against him, he persisted in his undertaking. His party
rapidly increased and soon obtained the superiority, not
indeed throughout the whole mass of the public, but in
that portion of society which was most enlightened and
refined.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>The other circumstances of Boscan’s life, in so far
as they are known, have little interest for the literary
historian. The mature part of his age was chiefly spent
in his native city Barcelona, or in the neighbouring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
country. The urbanity of his manners and his talents
recommended him to the family of Alba, which was
then one of the most brilliant of the noble houses of
Castile, and to which the homage of the Spanish poets
was from that time constantly paid. Boscan was for
some time Ayo, or first governor of the young Don Fernando
de Alba, who was afterwards the terror of the
enemies of the Spanish monarchy. He appears, however,
to have soon resigned this employment, in order to
divide his time between study and the society of literary
friends. The year in which he died is not exactly
known; it is only ascertained that his death happened
before the year 1544.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> He prepared for the press a
collection of his poems, to which he added those of his
friend Garcilaso; but the work was not published until
after his death.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>From the point at which Boscan found Castilian
poetry, to that in which it was necessary it should be
placed before he could open for himself a new path, the
distance was considerable, and the transition was to be accomplished
by a single bound. That he succeeded in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
undertaking was owing not so much to his genius, as to
a natural susceptibility for the real beauties of Italian
and ancient poetry, accidentally excited at the favourable
moment, and to a talent for the imitation of classical
models, without altogether discarding that tone of feeling
which was properly his own. To estimate, however, the
full value of Boscan’s talent, it is not only necessary to
examine the works by which he introduced a new style
into Spanish poetry, but to take a retrospective view of
the productions of the Castilian muse in the ancient
manner. It is only by this comparison that a just conception
can be formed of the surprise with which the
Spaniards must have regarded the bold attempt of
Boscan. He was the first among his countrymen who
had an idea of classical perfection in works of imagination;
and though the greater part of his poems fall
below that standard, they all afford evidence of his
endeavours to reach it. An aspiration so entirely unaffected
and unembarrassed, had never been manifested
by any previous Spanish poet. Between the kind of
poetry which he introduced into his native land and
that which he abandoned, there was no visible passage.
But lest the merits of Boscan should be too highly
rated, it is proper to observe, that at this time a reform
of the Spanish poetry, precisely such as that to which
his efforts gave birth, was, notwithstanding the clamour
of his opponents, desired by the more cultivated part of
the Spanish public, though, perhaps, there no where
existed any distinct perception of the wished-for object.
Had it been otherwise, Boscan must have stood alone,
and the numerous poets of his nation, who have equalled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
or surpassed him in the new style, never would have
followed his example.</p>

<p>The early productions of Boscan, which form the
first book of his works, are scarcely distinguishable by
any trace of superior delicacy or correctness from the
poems of the same descriptions contained in the <i>Cancionero
general</i>. The very title of the longest of
these youthful essays, namely, <i>Mar de Amor</i> (the Sea
of Love) excites an anticipation of the fantastic flights
of the old Spanish muse; and it is impossible to read
the first strophe without being convinced that the author
still adhered to the original character of Castilian song.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>
It was, however, only at the request of his friend Garcilaso
de la Vega, who said that he received from these
poems the same sort of pleasure as from pretty children,
that Boscan renounced his intention of entirely suppressing
them.</p>

<p>The second book of Boscan’s poems, contains <i>sonetos</i>
and <i>canciones</i>, in the style of the Italian <i>sonetti</i> and
<i>canzoni</i>. They all betray, in a greater or less degree,
the disciple of the school of Petrarch; but the spirit
of Spanish poetry still displays itself throughout the
whole. The language, though it successfully imitates
the precision of Petrarch, seldom attains the sweetly
flowing melody of its model. In painting the feelings,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the shadows are charged with stronger colours than the
Italian Petrarchists of the sixteenth century permitted
themselves to employ. Impetuous passion, which, with
higher pretensions, was, on account of its very violence,
less capable of commanding sympathy than a mild enthusiasm,
strikingly distinguished Boscan’s poetry from
that which was the object of his imitation. The contrast
was farther increased by the constantly recurring
picture of a struggle between passion and reason.
But these were precisely the traits which disclosed the
true Spanish character. It was not individual feeling
that prevented Boscan from equalling the delicacy and
softness of the Italian sonetto and canzone, for as his
biography, and still more his other poems, shew he was
a man of a very mild disposition. But it was necessary
that the language of love, to appear natural and true
to a Spaniard, should burn and rage. At the same
time, to satisfy Spanish taste, reason was to be introduced
to deliver her precepts amidst the storm of passion,
to prove its force by her feebleness, and to give to lyric
composition a moral gravity which was not desired by
the Italians. In so far however as the Spanish character
permitted the experiment to go, the fascinating tone of
Petrarch was very happily seized by Boscan;<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
the expression of tender passion he has even sometimes
surpassed the Italian poet.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<p>The greater part of the third book of these
poems is occupied by a paraphrastic translation of
the Greek poem of Hero and Leander. Nothing of
the kind had been previously known in the Spanish
language. The metrical form which Boscan chose
for his translation, was that of rhymeless iambics, or
an imitation of the blank verse of the Italians. The
language is so pure and elegant, the versification so
natural, and the tone of the narrative so soft, and at
the same time so elevated, that it is impossible not to
be pleased even with the prolixity which the influence
of the taste for romantic poetry has introduced into
this free translation. To this translation succeeds a
poem in the Italian style, entitled a <i>Capitulo</i>, and some
epistles in tercets. The <i>Capitulo</i>, as it is called, is a
love elegy, abounding in pleasing ideas and images, but
on the whole too much spun out, like most Italian poems
of the same kind. It has also its full share of genuine
Spanish hyperbole and amorous despair.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
best of his epistles is, “The Answer to Diego Mendoza,”
who was himself the first epistolary poet among the
Spaniards, and whom it will soon be necessary to notice
more at length. After the new poetical career was
opened, these authors vied in imitating the epistles of
Horace; but it is plain that the elegiac tenderness of
Tibullus was constantly present to the mind of Boscan.
In his Answer to Mendoza, the descriptions of domestic
and rural life charm by their exquisite delicacy, and
possess a still more powerful interest than the moral
reflections, though these are unaffected and noble, and
conceived in the true spirit of didactic poetry.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>Boscan’s works conclude with a narrative poem in
the Italian style, which has no other title than that
which denotes the structure of the verse, namely,
<i>octava rima</i>. Some ideas and images are borrowed
from the Italian poets; but the whole invention and
the execution of the greater part of the details belong
to Boscan. The merit of the fable, however, is
not great. A mythological allegory, describing the
empire of love, forms the introduction to a poetical
relation of a festal meeting of Venus, Cupid, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
other inhabitants of that imaginary region. Little
Cupids are dispatched all over the world by Venus to
defend her against the reproaches of unreasonable men,
and to make known the real blessings of love. One of
those winged envoys directs his course towards Barcelona,
the natal city of the poet, gives a particular account
of his mission to the fair ladies of that town, and takes
the opportunity of saying many gallant things to them.
As to the construction of the fable of this poem, Boscan
certainly gave himself very little trouble. His object
appears merely to have been to compose a romantic
picture of greater extent than a sonnet or a cancion,
and to make his countrymen sensible of the charm of
descriptive poetry in the Italian manner. It is impossible
not to admire the grace and facility with which
Boscan has accomplished this purpose. The descriptions
are so animated,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> and all the details so elegant and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
engaging, that the tediousness of some of the parts is
amply compensated by the happy execution of the
whole. Light plays of fancy embellish the lyric and
romantic passages; and, upon the whole, this is a work
which no other of the same kind by later Spanish poets
has excelled.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>If a comprehensive view be taken of the merits of
Boscan, it will be impossible, notwithstanding the
striking faults which appear in his works, and particularly
in his sonnets, to withhold from him the title of
the first classical poet of Spain. Some of his expressions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
are now antiquated, but upon the whole his language
has continued a model for succeeding ages. Simplicity
and dignity had never, in the same degree, and
under a form so correct, been united with poetic truth
and feeling by any previous Spanish author. The partizans
of the old national poetry reproached him with
being an imitator; but without the kind of imitation
by which he naturalized in his language a taste for the
literature of Italy and the ancient classics, it would
have been impossible for Spanish poetry to have gained
that field in which it afterwards competed with the
Italian. That he did not obtrude upon his countrymen
a kind of poetry irreconcilable with the genius of the
language and the national character, is evident from
the rapidity with which the new taste spread over the
whole of Spain, and extended into Portugal, and from
its duration in both kingdoms. The poetic innovators,
at whose head Boscan stood, were certainly blameable,
in so far as they wished to banish entirely the ancient
Spanish style, which was also, in its own manner, susceptible
of classical improvement. But it is doubtful
whether the partizans of that style would have thought
of perfecting it after classical models, had not the disciples
of the Italian school unexpectedly shewn the high
cultivation of which Spanish poetry was capable under
new forms. This Boscan first made manifest, not by
critical reasoning, but by example; and his modesty
contributed not a little to attract to his party the more
liberal minded of his countrymen. Had he commenced
his reform by trying to beat down the old
style with theoretical argument, or egotistical declamation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
he would only have rendered himself an object
of ridicule; for the public he had to deal with was
not indisposed to improvement, but would not submit
to have lessons read to it magisterially.</p>

<p>After Boscan, his friends, who participated in the
fame of that reform to which he shewed the way, are
justly entitled to the next place in the history of Spanish
poetry.</p>

<h3 id="GARCILASO_DE_LA_VEGA">GARCILASO DE LA VEGA.</h3>

<p>The first Spanish poet who followed the example of
Boscan was Garcilaso de la Vega, a young Castilian,
descended from a family of consideration in Toledo,
and born, according to the statements of different
authors, either in 1500 or 1503. His poetic talent was
early developed, and he had written several lyric pieces
in the old Spanish style, when his acquaintance with
Boscan, which soon grew into friendship, commenced.
The character of the poetry of the ancients and of
Italy was then seen by him in a new light. He proceeded
with ardour to the study of classical models, and
of Petrarch and Virgil in particular. The improvement
of pastoral poetry in his native tongue, appears to have
been his first object. But it was his lot to follow the
restless profession of arms; and the wars of Charles V.
carried him abroad, and dragged him from country to
country. In the year 1529, he distinguished himself
in the Spanish corps, which was attached to the imperial
army opposed to the Turks. While in Vienna he was
involved in a romantic intrigue, between a near relation
of his own and a lady of the court. The imperial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
dignity, it appears, was conceived to be compromised
by this intrigue, and Garcilaso was punished for his interference
by imprisonment in an Island of the Danube.
There he composed one of his canciones, in which
he bewails his destiny, but at the same time celebrates
the Danube and the countries through which
it flows.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> His imprisonment probably was not of long
duration. In the year 1535, he served in the adventurous
expedition of Charles V. against Tunis, in which
he acquired both glory and wounds. In Naples and
Sicily, he devoted, as far as circumstances would permit,
his moments of relaxation to poetry. He execrated
war, and exerted all the powers of his imagination in
painting an Arcadian pastoral life, but still remained a
soldier.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> It may be presumed, however, that his military
talents were not inconsiderable, for when the
imperial army in the year 1536, penetrated into the
South of France, Garcilaso de la Vega, who could then
be only thirty-three, or at most thirty-six years of age,
commanded eleven companies of infantry. That campaign,
which did not terminate so fortunately as it
commenced, was the last to Garcilaso, and tore him
from the world in the bloom of life. The emperor in
person ordered him to take by assault, a fort, the
garrison of which harrassed the army in its retreat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
Garcilaso executed this command with more gallantry
than prudence. He wished to be the first to scale the
walls. He attained his object, but was struck with a
stone on the head, and thrown down from the ramparts.
Being mortally wounded, he was removed to Nice,
where, a few weeks after, he died.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to discover from the works of
Garcilaso, that the author had spent a considerable
portion of his short life in camps, and had died in the
bed of military honour, the victim of his courage; for
he approaches even more closely than Boscan to the
tenderness of Petrarch. The general tone of his poetry
is so soft and melancholy, that it is only by occasional
characteristic traits, that the Spaniard is recognized;
but it must be confessed that when such passages do
occur, the exaggeration is striking enough.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> In his
sonnets, which are not numerous, the imitation of
Petrarch is obvious; but he sometimes betrays that
affectation of wit, which was still in Spain regarded as
an ingenious manner of expressing vehement and profound
passion.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> One however exhibits throughout a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
delicacy of style and sweetness of manner, equalled by
few pieces of the same kind, in the Spanish language.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>
He was not equally successful in seizing the character
of the Italian canzone, of which he, as well as Boscan,
was an imitator; and his reputation rests chiefly on his
pastoral poems, which therefore deserve to be more
particularly noticed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>Since the rude dramatic eclogues of Juan de la
Enzina pastoral poetry had made no progress in Spain.
But Garcilaso de la Vega imitated Virgil and Sanazzar,
and so happily united the romantic character with the
correctness of the ancients, that his eclogues, though
only one of them can be regarded as a masterpiece,
surpass all Italian poems of the kind, those in the
Arcadia of Sanazzar alone excepted. The fine Neapolitan
sky appears to have had the same influence on
Garcilaso as on Virgil and Sanazzar; and he seems to
have regarded Naples as his poetical country. The
first of his eclogues is by far the most beautiful, and
marks an epoch in Spanish pastoral poetry. The whole
composition has the metrical form of an Italian canzone.
The invention is very simple. In the four
introductory strophes, in which is interwoven a dedication
to the Viceroy of Naples, Don Pedro de Toledo,
Marquis of Villafranca, the author describes, with all
the simplicity which belongs to true pastoral poetry,
the meeting of two shepherds, Salicio and Nemoroso,
who alternately give vent to their feelings in melancholy
strains. These elegiac songs reply to each other without
interruption, and the relation subsisting between them
gives to the whole lyric composition a proper consistence
and unity. This is all the plan of the eclogue. But
the glow of enthusiastic feeling, the happy choice of
expression, and the harmony of versification so completely
satisfactory to the ear, to be found in almost
every line of these songs of sorrow, cannot fail to give
delight to every mind susceptible of elegiac and beauty.
Accordingly the Spanish critics are nearly unanimous in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
pronouncing this eclogue one of the finest works in
their language. The subject of the first song is the
infidelity&mdash;of the second, the death of a mistress; and
the latter complaint appears to be founded in fact. But
Garcilaso would have better secured the sympathy of the
more scrupulous Spanish reader, had he entirely passed
over the cause of the lamented fair one’s decease. The
lady whom he describes as a pastoral nymph, lost her
life it seems in childbed; for an apostrophe of the complaining
shepherd to Lucina, indicates plainly enough
the nature of her death. But is the affected delicacy
which takes offence at a trait so truly natural and
pathetic, worthy of the attention of an author? In the
first strain in which the shepherd Salicio deplores the
infidelity of his mistress, the interest appears to be raised
as far as it is possible to carry it.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> Passion is here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
elevated to the highest pitch, and then lost in a most
affecting self sacrifice.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> But the song in which Nemoroso
laments the death of his mistress, even surpasses
the former in elegiac force, perhaps because it possesses
greater softness. In retracing his recollections the
mourner draws a series of melancholy pictures which
have an indescribable charm. The beauty of the poem
rises with the description of the beauty of the departed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
shepherdess.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> The passage in which Nemoroso relates
how he carries in his bosom a lock of his Eliza’s hair,
from which he is never separated&mdash;how when alone he
spreads it out, weeps over it, dries it with his sighs, and
then examines and counts every single hair&mdash;is unexampled
either in ancient or modern literature.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Occasional imitations of Virgil have been pointed out,
but they harmonize so completely with the romantic
spirit of the poem, that were it not for the particular
references which critics have made, they would in general
escape the notice of even the most erudite. The poem,
as a whole, is evidently the genuine offspring of the
author’s soul. Materials of an affecting but prosaic nature
are, by his art, converted into the most graceful
and impressive poetry.</p>

<p>As Garcilaso only imitated the ancients by the
introduction of certain ideas and images, and not in
the structure of his eclogues, he considered himself at
liberty to vary their form at pleasure. But here his
good taste abandoned him. The second and longest of
his eclogues is an unnatural mixture of heterogeneous
styles. An unfortunate shepherd deplores his unsuccessful
love. Another shepherd joins him, and their
conversation proceeds unconstrained in a romantic pastoral
tone; but it is impossible to discover any reason
for the changes which take place in the verse. Tercets
are succeeded by rhymeless iambics, after which the
tercets re-appear and are followed by the syllabic measure
of a canzone. The simple dialogue suddenly becomes
dramatic. The fair huntress, whose indifference is
the subject of the first shepherd’s lament, appears upon
the scene. The lover seizes and refuses to let her go, until
she swears to listen to his addresses. She makes the required
vow, and when at liberty flies. The despair of
the shepherd then becomes frenzy; and a third shepherd,
who has in the mean time arrived, enters into conversation
with the one who first joined the unhappy lover,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
on the means of restoring him to reason. The author
seizes this opportunity to convert his eclogue into a
most unseasonable eulogium on the house of Alba.
One of the shepherds proposes that medical assistance
should be obtained, and mentions a physician named
Severo; but this name is assigned to a learned friend of
Garcilaso and the Alba family. Nothing more is necessary,
according to the critical conception of the author,
to warrant the making a poetical digression from his
account of the merits of the physician, whose miraculous
skill is to recover the frantic shepherd, to the
history of the house of Alba, which he details in iambic
blank verse.</p>

<p>In the third and last of Garcilaso’s eclogues, the
genuine pastoral character is resumed. The lyric dialogue
in octaves, or Italian stanzas, pleasingly harmonizes
with the soft description of amatory sorrows given
in this poem.</p>

<p>Garcilaso made essays in other kinds of poetry, but
with less success. An elegy written to console the
Duke of Alba for the death of his brother, is an imitation,
or rather a translation of an Italian poem by
Frascatoro, and is at once cold and verbose. More of
interest belongs to another elegy which is addressed to
Boscan, and which the author wrote at the foot of
Mount Etna. Mythological recollections excited by
that classic ground, melancholy complaints of the
miseries of war, and tender anxieties for a loved object
in the poet’s native land, diffuse a charm over
the whole of this elegant poem, which is besides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
remarkable for comparisons and images full of novelty
and truth.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>Garcilaso is also the author of a small epistle in which
he has endeavoured to seize the true horatian tone. It
is not sufficiently important to deserve particular notice,
but it is easy to recognize in it the fine tact of this
author, to whom the critic, however severely he may
judge his faults, cannot deny the title of the second
classic poet of Spain.</p>

<h3 id="DIEGO_DE_MENDOZA">DIEGO DE MENDOZA.</h3>

<p>The third classic poet, and at the same time the
first classic prose writer of Spain, is Don Diego Hurtado
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
de Mendoza,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> a native of Granada, where he was born
in the beginning of the sixteenth century, but in what
year is not known. Descended from one of the first
familes of the country, he had before him the prospect
of high honours, which, as he was one of five
children, his parents destined him to reach through the
church. Being educated for the clerical profession, he
received what was then considered a learned education.
Besides the classical languages of antiquity, he acquired
the Hebrew and Arabic. At the university of Salamanca,
he studied scholastic philosophy, theology, and
ecclesiastical law. While yet a student he was the
inventor of the comic romance or novel, for it was at
Salamanca that he wrote his celebrated work, the Life
of Lazarillo de Tormes. Having become as conspicuous
for a vigorous and sound understanding as for his
wit and learning, the Emperor Charles V. who perceived
that his talents might be employed with advantage
in public business, drew him from his studies. He
had not long left the university when he was appointed
imperial envoy to Venice. He availed himself of the
opportunities which this situation afforded to cultivate
an intercourse with learned Italians, and to obtain an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
intimate knowledge of the spirit of Italian literature.
Before his departure for Italy, he appears to have
formed an acquaintance with Boscan; but he was
patriot enough not to despise the old Spanish poetry.
Though he loved the Italian poets, he preferred the
ancients, and in particular Horace, who, like himself a
man of the world, might occasionally assist him in his
journey through the slippery path of political life; and
certainly few poets could have divided themselves between
literature and politics with as much dexterity as
Mendoza. He was, however, far from being a cringing
courtier. His low opinion of diplomatic dignity is
stated frankly, and even somewhat coarsely, in one of
his epistles, in which he exclaims:&mdash;“O these ambassadors,
the perfect ninnies! when kings wish to cheat
they begin with us. Our best business is to take care
that we do no harm, and indeed never to do or say any
thing that we may not run the risk of making ourselves
understood.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> The ambassador of a prince of
such deep dissimulation as Charles V. might naturally
enough form an unfavourable opinion of his office; but
he who could speak his mind in this manner, even
when at his post, must have retained some of the spirit
of old Spanish freedom.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>The emperor made no mistake in the choice of his
ambassador, of whose turn of thinking he doubtless
was not ignorant, but on the exercise of whose talents
he knew he could rely. He considered him the fittest
person that could be selected to go to the council of
Trent, and recommend, by an elegant manner, the truths
he wished to be told to the assembled fathers in the
name of the Spanish nation. This commission Mendoza
executed to the satisfaction of the emperor. The
speech which he delivered before the council in 1545
was highly admired, and Charles was convinced that it
was impossible to confide the affairs of Italy to better
hands. In the year 1547, Mendoza appeared at the
papal court, then the centre of all political intrigues, as
imperial ambassador, and invested with powers which
rendered him the terror of the French party in Italy.
The emperor at the same time appointed him captain-general
and governor of Sienna, and other strong places
in Tuscany. He was ordered to humble the pope,
Paul III. even in his own court; and to repress, by
force, the movements of the restless Florentines, who
still hoped, under the protection of France, to shake
off the yoke of the Medicis. A man of less firmness
of character would have been totally unfit for such a
task; but the terrible energy with which Mendoza performed
it, exasperated in the highest degree the opposite
party, and more particularly the Florentines. The
repeated insurrections in Tuscany could not be suppressed
without measures of great severity, and Mendoza
was consequently detested as a tyrant by all Italians
who were not reconciled to the introduction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
Spanish garrisons. In Sienna he was constantly exposed
to assassination; and on one occasion, a musket
ball directed against him killed the horse on which he
rode. His intrepidity, however, was not to be shaken,
and he continued to administer his difficult government
until Paul III. died, and was succeeded by Julius III.
a pope inclined to the Spanish party. The new pope
wishing to bestow on Mendoza a particular mark of
respect, appointed him Gonfalonier, or Standard-bearer
to the church. In this character, Mendoza marched
against the rebels in the ecclesiastical territories, and
made them submit to the pope.</p>

<p>Thus did a Spanish poet, alike feared and admired,
govern Italy for the space of six years. During this
stormy period of his life, Mendoza composed verses,
visited the Italian universities, purchased Greek manuscripts,
and collected a large library. Since the days of
Petrarch no friend of literature had shewn so much
zeal for the acquisition of Greek manuscripts. He
spared no pains nor expense to procure them even from
Greece, and sent special messengers for that purpose to
the convent of Mount Athos. He availed himself of a
service he had rendered to the Ottoman sultan, to obtain
supplies of corn for the empty granaries of Venice,
and of manuscripts for his own library. Many a Greek
work came first to the press from his valuable collection.
Whoever wished to promote the study of ancient literature,
found in him a friend and protector; and to him
the learned bookseller, Paulus Manutius, dedicated his
edition of the philosophic writings of Cicero, to the
study of which Mendoza was particularly attached,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
and for the correct publication of which he even made
critical observations on the manuscripts.</p>

<p>Literature and politics, it appears, did not afford
sufficient occupation for this extraordinary man. He
chose also to engage in affairs of gallantry; and, according
to the manners of the age, gave to such pursuits, at
least in verse, the character of romantic passion. His
looks, however, were not calculated to recommend him
to the fair sex; for his biographers state that he was
far from handsome, and that the glance of his fiery eye
was more repulsive than inviting. But Mendoza was
active, accomplished, and in the possession of power;
and the favour which these advantages obtained for
him with some Roman ladies, was numbered among
the offences with which his enemies loudly reproached
him. The repeated charges brought against him made
at last an impression on the emperor; and that monarch,
who had begun to contemplate the resignation
of his crown, and who was now desirous of establishing
tranquillity in his states, thought fit, in the year 1554,
to recall this too rigid governor to Spain.</p>

<p>The latter part of the history of Mendoza’s life is
not uniformly related by his biographers. According
to some he retired to the country, devoted himself to
poetry and philosophy, and appeared very seldom at
the court of Philip II. Others assert that, though he
no longer retained his former influence, he continued a
member of the council of state under Philip II. and
was present with that monarch at the great battle of
St. Quintin, fought in the year 1557. This much is
certain, that he was soon after engaged in an adventure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
at the court, which, for a man of his age and knowledge
of the world, was of a very singular nature. An
altercation arose in the palace between him and a courtier,
who, according to Mendoza’s own declaration, was
his rival in the affections of a lady. This man, whose
name is not mentioned, in a fit of violent exasperation,
drew a dagger; upon which Mendoza seized him, and
threw him from a balcony into the street. What afterwards
became of his antagonist is not recorded; but the
transaction was the subject of serious observation, and
the grave Philip regarded it as a high offence against the
dignity of his person and his court. He was, however,
content to inflict a moderate punishment, and merely
condemned Mendoza to a short imprisonment. The
old statesman occupied the period of his imprisonment
in the ancient Spanish style, namely, in composing lamentations
on the unkindness of his mistress:<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> and these
romantic effusions do not appear to have been considered
by his contemporaries as absurd and ridiculous at
his time of life. But the sorrows expressed in his amatory
ditties did not drive the venerable lover to despair;
for when he was soon after set at liberty, though still
exiled from court, he observed with the eye of a politician
the insurrection of the Moriscoes, or converted
Arabs of Granada; and when the insurrection broke
out into a formal war, he noted down all the remarkable
events, and afterwards detailed them in an historical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
work, which has obtained for him the name of the
Spanish Sallust. He profited of this opportunity to
collect a great number of Arabic manuscripts. Observations
on the works of Aristotle, a translation of the Mechanics
of that philosopher, and some political treatises,
were, it appears, the last of his literary labours. He
was thus actively and usefully employed until his death,
which happened when he was upwards of seventy, at
Valladolid, in the year 1575. He bequeathed his collection
of books and manuscripts to the king, and it
still forms one of the most valuable portions of the
library of the Escurial.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>A detailed account of the life of this distinguished
man, cannot be regarded as a biographical excrescence
in a history of Spanish Literature; for in no other
poet’s life and works is the real Castilian spirit of the
age of Charles V. so clearly displayed as in those of
Diego de Mendoza. The universality of his literary talent
will be best understood, when it is known with what
energy, precision, and facility he accommodated himself
to, and controuled the circumstances in which he
happened to be placed in all the practical relations of life.
That trait too in the portrait of his mind, which is most
worthy of observation, namely, the constancy with
which, instead of abandoning one species of mental
activity for another, he continued throughout the
different periods of his life, from youth to extreme
old age, always to unite in his person the poet, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
man of letters, and the statesman, gives reason to
expect that his works, however differing in kind, will
be found to possess a certain common character.</p>

<p>Diego de Mendoza did more for the poetic literature
of his country than his countrymen seem to have acknowledged.
Spanish writers, it is true, place him
next in rank to Boscan and Garcilaso de la Vega,
among the poets who introduced the Italian style into
Castilian poetry. But they cannot pardon the harshness
of his versification in those poems in which he
adopted the metrical forms of Italy. Rendered fastidious
by the rhythmical harmony which a Castilian
ear can never dispense with, the Spaniards have held in
very trifling estimation the epistles of Mendoza; though
those compositions, in a striking manner, extended
the boundaries of Castilian poetry. As an epistolary
poet, he might justly be styled the Spanish Horace, if
his tercets flowed as smoothly as the hexameters of the
latin poet. Making allowance, however, for the want of
that pure harmony and that didactic delicacy in which
Horace is inimitable, Mendoza’s epistles may rank
among the best productions of the kind in modern
literature. With the exception of Boscan and Garcilaso
de la Vega, no Spanish poet had evinced any traces
of that horatian spirit with which this author was
endowed. In the collection of Mendoza’s poems, these
epistles are merely called <i>cartas</i> (letters.) Some of
them are of a romantic cast, and overloaded with
tedious love complaints. But the rest, like Horace’s
epistles, are didactic, full of agreeable but sound philosophy,
precise and yet unconstrained in expression,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
and rescued from the monotonous effect of moral instruction,
by a happy interchange of precepts, images,
and characters. A masculine understanding, which
clearly penetrates all social relations, and a noble spirit,
which estimates the blessings of life according to their
real value, diffuse over these epistles a charm at once
serene and attractive. Some of the most beautiful,
for example, that addressed to Boscan, which is best
known, and which on account of the answer is printed
among Boscan’s poems, were composed in Italy during
the more early part of the author’s life. But in estimating
the poetical works of Mendoza, chronological
arrangement is of little importance, for as a poet he
preserved equality from the commencement to the close
of his career. His epistle to Boscan is in part an imitation
of that of Horace to Numicius.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> The latter
half, however, belongs exclusively to Mendoza. In this
portion of the epistle he presents to his friend the outline
of the charming picture of domestic happiness, to
which Boscan himself, in the answer already mentioned,
has given a higher finish; and the taste which can
overlook the beauty of this picture on account of want
of smoothness in the versification, must be depraved by
the affectation of refinement.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Another epistle, addressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
to Don Luis de Zuñiga, contains an ingenious and
striking comparison of the character of two heterogeneous
and equally foolish classes of men. The one
wholly attached to the vulgar pleasures of the moment,
and stupidly indifferent to the affairs of the world;<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
while the other, on the contrary, is cheated by restless
cares and anxieties out of the enjoyment of the present.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
In these epistles, Mendoza unfolded the result
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
of his experience, as the Infante Juan Manuel did
a century and a half earlier, in his Count Lucanor,
though in a totally different manner. Mendoza’s style
is that of an accomplished man of the world, formed
in the school of the latin poets.</p>

<p>Mendoza’s sonnets possess neither the grace nor
the harmony essential to that species of composition.
They owe their existence to the amatory spirit of the
age rather than to the poetic inspiration of the author.
Though he composed in the Italian manner with less
facility than Boscan and Garcilaso, he felt more correctly
than they or any other of his countrymen, the
difference between the Spanish and Italian languages,
with respect to their capabilities for versification. The
Spanish admits of none of those pleasing elisions, which,
particularly when terminating vowels are omitted, render
the mechanism of Italian versification so easy, and
enable the poet to augment or diminish the number of
syllables according to his pleasure; and this difference
in the two languages renders the composition of a
Spanish sonnet a difficult task. Still more does the
Spanish language seem hostile to the soft termination
of a succession of feminine rhymes, for the Spanish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
poet, who adopts this rule of the Italian sonnet, is
compelled to banish from his rhymes, all infinitives of
verbs, together with a whole host of sonorous substantives
and adjectives.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> Mendoza, therefore, availed
himself of the use of masculine rhymes in his sonnets;
but this metrical license was strongly censured by all
partizans of the Italian style. Nevertheless had he
given to his sonnets more of the tenderness of Petrarch,
it is probable that they would have found imitators.
Some of them, indeed, may be considered as successful
productions, and throughout all the language is correct
and noble.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>Mendoza’s canciones have nearly the same character
as his sonnets, except that they more obviously mark the
influence of the horatian ode on the lyric fancy of the
author. The versification, which is sonorous, though
deficient in harmony, is occasionally united with a degree
of obscurity from which the other productions of
Mendoza are totally exempt.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> The least successful of
his poems in the Italian style is a mythological tale
in octave verse, founded on the history of Adonis, but
along with which the author has interwoven the history
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
of Atalanta. The story is, however, related in a very
pleasing manner.</p>

<p>The Spaniards give the preference, not to this first
class of the poetic works of Mendoza, but to the second,
which consists of lyric poems in the old national style,
the origin of which it is, however, easy to perceive
must be referred to a more highly cultivated age. The
similarity between these poems and others of the same
sort in the <i>Romancero general</i>, clearly proves that
many of the poets of the age of Charles V. had tacitly
agreed to improve the old national poetry, without, like
the impetuous Castillejo, (of whom further mention will
soon be made) waging open war against the reformers
of the school of Boscan. Many of Mendoza’s lyric
pieces are inserted in the <i>Romancero general</i> without
the author’s name. In these compositions the syllabic
measure seems to have been the chief object of improvement.
But this improvement, however successful,
was at the same time necessarily limited; and the beautiful
forms of the Italian canzone possessed too striking
a superiority over the most cultivated forms of rhyme
in the old redondillas, to yield to the latter in any
collision. All Mendoza’s lyric compositions are in
stanzas of four lines; and the pieces of this description
now obtained, by way of distinction, the name of
redondillas, which seems originally to have been applied
to all trochaic verses in lines of four feet.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> But songs
in stanzas of five lines, though in other respects similar
to those just mentioned, are called in Mendoza’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
collection <i>quintas</i> or <i>quintillas</i>. The trochaic stanza in
four lines of three feet,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> of which the <i>Romancero general</i>
also contains several specimens, was found to be most
suitable to <i>endechas</i>, or funeral songs, in the old national
style, and to compositions of that class Mendoza
applied it. He wrote many romantic epistles in the
redondilla stanza of four lines; and did not neglect
the other old lyric forms, such as the <i>Villancicos</i>,
&amp;c. The improvement of style, which is an essential
feature of all these poems, was limited by Mendoza
to accuracy of expression, and to softening the quaintness
of the old subtilties: to these, however, he himself
sometimes resorted; and he seems to have been of
opinion, that the character of this kind of poetry rendered
their occasional introduction indispensable. In
compositions of a tender and melancholy character,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
he is less successful than in those of a comic
cast.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>Considering Mendoza’s wit and knowledge of mankind,
it may naturally be presumed that his satyrical
poems, which however exist only in manuscript, mark
a great advancement in this species of poetry in Spain.
These poems are mentioned by all Mendoza’s biographers;
one is called <i>La Pulga</i> (the Flea,) another <i>La Caña</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
(the Reed), and a third bears the comical title of <i>Elogio
de la Zanahoria</i> (Eulogy on the Parsnip.) None, however,
have yet passed the ordeal of the inquisition.
Their titles seem to indicate a kind of coarse humour in
the style of the burlesque satyres of the Italians.</p>

<p>Some of Mendoza’s prose compositions have, however,
obtained greater celebrity than his poems; and
they unquestionably form an epoch in the history of
Spanish prose. The comic romance of <i>Lazarillo de
Tormes</i>, which Mendoza wrote while he was a student
at Salamanca, is either the very first production of its
kind, or at least the first that obtained any thing like
literary consideration. Soon after its publication it was
translated into Italian, and subsequently into French,
and by the means of this French translation it has
been read throughout all Europe. Relations of interesting
tricks of roguery, probably formed at a more
early period a favourite amusement with the Spaniards;
for that adroit feats of cunning and deception have had
for them a charm of a peculiar kind, the whole history
of their comic literature sufficiently proves. Mendoza,
therefore, gave to his humorous fancy a direction conformable
to the spirit of his country, when he chose, as
the subject of his work, the Adventures of a Beggar Lad,
who makes a kind of fortune by dint of cheating and
roguery; and the comic interest of the production was
enhanced by its contrast with the pompous romances
of chivalry. In the perusal of such a tale, the Spanish
reader willingly descended from the romantic ideal
world to the sphere of common life. The skill with
which Mendoza has sketched the vices of avarice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
and selfishness in the persons into whose service
Lazarillo enters, is no less remarkable than the bold
regard for truth which led him to include priests in the
number of his odious characters. The inquisition of
course could not expect that the Spaniards should
regard the ecclesiastic profession as a security against
every vice; and Lazarillo de Tormes sufficiently proves
that in Mendoza’s time the priesthood was not guaranteed
against public satire in Spain. Under the reign of
Philip II. however, satires of this kind became subject to
a certain degree of restraint; and since that period Mendoza’s
romance has only been suffered to escape because
its free circulation was once permitted by the inquisition.
No critic has hitherto called in question the truth
and accuracy of the pictures of vulgar life in Lazarillo
de Tormes; but an author named de Luna, who styles
himself an interpreter of the Castilian language, published
a new edition of the romance with the view of
correcting the diction. De Luna likewise added a
second part to the story, for Mendoza in his maturer
years never felt inclined to finish the comic work which
he had commenced in his youth.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p id="MENDOZAS_ACCOUNT_OF_THE_REBELLION_OF_GRANADA">A very different spirit animates the historical work
in which Mendoza traces the history of the rebellion
of Granada.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> Mendoza formed his style, as a historian,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
principally on that of Sallust, and only occasionally
imitated Tacitus for the sake of variety. Were it not
that he sometimes oversteps the bounds of true elegance
and falls into an overstudied and artificial manner,
this work might be ranked, without reserve, among the
best historical models; and notwithstanding the affectation
with which it is here and there disfigured,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> it
is, unquestionably, after the works of Machiavell and
Guicciardini, the first production of modern literature
that deserves to be compared with the classic histories
of antiquity.</p>

<p>However carefully Mendoza polished the rhetorical
form of his history, still the importance of the materials
and a true philosophic spirit are every where prominent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
throughout his representation of facts. Being
himself a native of Granada, his power of rightly
viewing the events, and the impression he received
from them, must have been much the same as if he
had been an eye witness of all that passed. Besides,
he derived his information from the most authentic
sources; for at the period in question he was residing
on his estate in the vicinity of the theatre of the war.
His nephew, the Marquis de Mondejar, was for some
time commander in chief of the army against the
rebels; and Mendoza himself had long been so intimately
connected with the government at Madrid, that
no individual in Spain had better opportunities of
obtaining that knowledge of the secret as well as of
the ostensible springs of transactions which is necessary
for a just historical representation of events. The
atrocious measures adopted by Phillip II. to suppress
the insurrection in Granada, were, however, no less
opposed to the sound political views of Mendoza, than
the fanatic cruelty and glaring injustice by which the
unhappy Moriscos had been driven into rebellion appear,
however good a catholic he may have been, to
have revolted his feelings. But neither his opinion nor
his compassion could be openly avowed. He therefore
availed himself of all the subtle windings of the historical
art, to render his representation of events easily
intelligible to those who thought as he did, and at the
same time to secure himself against any literal interpretation
which spiritual or temporal despotism might have
employed to his disadvantage. Wherever undeniable
facts, which the government according to its own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
maxims could not venture to conceal, clearly expose
the folly and inhumanity by which the Moors were
reduced to despair, Mendoza apparently refrains from
pronouncing any judgment, while the poignant manner
in which he relates the facts, is in itself a sufficient
condemnation.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>When the fault rests rather with the agents of
the government than with the government itself, he
seems to attack only the former. In order that the
just cause of the Moriscos might be, for once, powerfully
vindicated, he puts, after the manner of the
ancients, a speech into the mouth of one of the chiefs
of the conspirators.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> This is the only speech in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
work which seems sufficient to shew that at least it
was not inserted from a spirit of servile imitation; but
he occasionally ventures, contrary to the practice of
modern languages, to approximate his narrative style
to that of the writers of antiquity; as for example,
where he employs a succession of verbs in the infinitive
mood.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> The Spaniards, however, seem to have regarded
the grammatical freedom used by Mendoza as perfectly
conformable to the genius of their language. During
the gloomy and suspicious government of Philip II.
this excellent work was only to be read in manuscript.
It was first published at Madrid, in the year 1610, five-and-thirty
years after the death of the author, and was
reprinted at Lisbon in 1617; but both editions were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
purposely mutilated.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> The text was at last given complete
in the edition of the work, which appeared in
1776.</p>

<h3 id="SAA_DE_MIRANDA">SAA DE MIRANDA.</h3>

<p>The fame of the great reform of the Castilian
poetry having penetrated into Portugal, a similar reform
took place in the poetry of that nation. At this
time the Castilian language was held in such high consideration
in Portugal, that even Portuguese poets,
without undervaluing their national tongue, thought
themselves bound occasionally to write verses in Castilian,
to entitle them to be regarded as perfect masters
of the poetic art. In the first half of the sixteenth
century, two of the most celebrated of these Portuguese
poets laboured with such success to extend the dominion
of Castilian pastoral poetry, that the thread of
the history of Spanish literature would be broken, were
a notice of the poetic merits of these two celebrated
men confined solely to the history of the literature of
Portugal. One of them, Francisco de Saa de Miranda,
who was born in 1494, and died in 1558, belongs, however,
in so eminent a degree, to his own nation, and the
circumstances of his life are so closely connected with
the history of Portuguese poetry, that it would be an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
injustice to Portuguese literature to rank him exclusively
among the poets of Spain. Besides, most of his
poetic works, with the exception of his pastoral poems,
are written in the Portuguese language.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> The other
Portuguese poet, who claims attention in the history of
Spanish poetry, is Jorge de Montemayor. He, through
his residence in Spain, became wholly a Spaniard:&mdash;the
work to which he chiefly owes his celebrity is written
in Spanish; and he had so decided an influence on
Spanish literature, that this would be the proper place
for introducing an account of his short life and of his
poetry, did not Saa de Miranda’s Castilian pastorals,
which are of older date, demand a previous notice.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p>The bucolic effusions of Saa de Miranda exhibit
in their general tone more traits of resemblance to
Theocritus, than are to be found in the writings of
Garcilaso de la Vega. Garcilaso’s pastoral style, with
all its simplicity, was not sufficiently rural for Saa de
Miranda. Like Theocritus his feelings seem to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
dictated to him pure rural ideas; and he transferred
this characteristic of his Portuguese eclogues to those
which he wrote in Spanish, which are the most numerous.
Nevertheless, even in his rural poems he did not
wish to renounce the attributes of the loftier style of
poetry. He was, however, heedless of all critical distinction
of the different kinds of poetry, and would, without
scruple, commence a poem, in the metre of an Italian
canzone, as an ode, proceed with it in epic metaphors,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
and conclude it in the simplest idyllic style. With equal
indifference he chose sometimes octave verse, sometimes
tercets for his pastoral poems, which thus alternately
assume a lyric and a dramatic tone. This capricious
mixture of poetic genera and styles deteriorates in no
slight degree the quality of Saa de Miranda’s poetry.
The elevated tone of the ode forms a singular contrast
when introduced in the same composition along with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
the easy familiar style, which, in the opinion of Saa
de Miranda, the pure pastoral character of his poetry
required. But no modern poet has succeeded so well
in the union of simplicity and grace; and in this respect
the eclogues of Saa de Miranda are unequalled.
When he describes the gambols of the nymphs, with
whom his fancy animates his native woodland scenes;<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>&mdash;when
he sketches impetuous storms of passion, softened
by the charm of his colouring, yet kept true to nature;<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>&mdash;when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
he introduces nymphs discoursing;<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>&mdash;or, when he
abandons himself to a tone of elegiac melancholy;<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>&mdash;one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
knows not whether most to admire, the delicate truth
and penetrating depth of his ideas, or the artless precision
and facility of his expression. In such cases he
often abandons the natural style of Theocritus for a
more lofty or ideal manner. When, in some of his
other eclogues, his shepherds converse on their occupations
or superstitions,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> he likewise departs from the
prosaic nature of real pastoral life, such as he had the
opportunity of observing in his native country, and
gradually elevates it to romantic ideality. It happened,
however, that he occasionally found the prosaic truth of
his pictures sufficiently interesting, and then to be truly
natural he avoided all embellishment.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>Some of Saa de Miranda’s popular songs, called <i>Cantigas</i>,
a term which in Portuguese corresponds with <i>Villancicos</i>
in Spanish, are inimitable for grace and simplicity.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<h3 id="MONTEMAYOR">MONTEMAYOR.</h3>

<p>The poet who is celebrated in Spanish literature by
the name of Jorge de Montemayor, was born in the
year 1520, at Montemor, a little town of Portugal,
not far from Coimbra. He took for his name that of
his native city, spelt and pronounced in the Spanish
way, probably because his own family name was not
deemed sufficiently sonorous; and thus the latter has
been entirely lost. The talent of this young Portuguese
developed itself without the aid of a previous
literary cultivation. At an early period of life he
served in the Portuguese army, and, as there is reason
to believe, in the rank of a common soldier. His
taste for music, and the reputation he had acquired as
a singer, induced him to visit Spain, where the Infant
Don Philip, afterwards Philip II. had formed a company
of court musicians, who were to accompany him
on his travels through Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands.
Jorge de Montemayor, being admitted as a vocal
member of this travelling musical company, gained an
opportunity of seeing the world, and at the same time
making himself master of the Castilian language, which
became to him a second mother tongue. He was, however,
attached to Spain by a still closer link, namely,
his love for a beautiful Castilian lady, whom he occasionally
introduces in his poems under the name of
Marfida. This Marfida became the deity of his poetry;
and when, on his return to Spain, he found her wedded
to another, he endeavoured to divert his sorrow by
poetic effusions, in which he represented the faithless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
beauty as a romantic shepherdess; and, uniting these
with several of his other compositions, he formed the
whole into a romance. This romance, which he entitled
<i>Diana</i>, was received by the Spanish public with a
degree of favour never before extended to any Spanish
book, Amadis de Gaul excepted; and it speedily found
no fewer imitators than Amadis itself. The Queen of
Portugal was desirous that the celebrated author of
Diana should return to his native country. She recalled
him, and he obeyed the honourable mandate.
No further particulars of his history are known. He
died by some violent means, either in 1561 or 1562.
He was upwards of forty at the period of his death,
which, according to some accounts, took place in Portugal,
and according to others in Italy.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>The Diana of Montemayor is one of the few
romantic works which belong entirely to the soul of
the inventor, which are embued throughout with individual
interest, and which on that very account
exercise the more influence over unsophisticated minds,
because the author possessed sufficient poetic genius
successfully to convey the joys and sorrows of his own
heart under the forms of a general interest. But this
romance can never be to any other cultivated people
what it was to the Spaniards of the sixteenth century.
Still less can it be regarded as a classical fragment,
even though judged according to the lenient rules by
which every fragment is estimated; unless, indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
after the manner of some modern critics, new rules of
art be deduced from defective examples, for the sake
of admiring as incomparable the grossest absurdities,
under the title of romantic complexity. But with all
its faults, this unfinished pastoral romance (for it was
not brought to a conclusion by Montemayor) possesses
a poetic merit, which entitles it to the esteem of all
ages.</p>

<p>The design of the work, so far as Montemayor’s
ideas render his intention obvious, sometimes charms
by its graceful simplicity, and at others becomes grotesque,
through an illegitimate romantic combination of
heterogeneous species of composition. The shepherd
Sireno, who represents the poet himself, on his return
to his native country, visits the scene of the innocent
joys which the inconstant shepherdess Diana once
shared along with him. Overwhelmed with grief, he
draws out first a lock of hair belonging to his mistress;
and then one of her letters, which he reads. While he
is thus communing with himself, he is joined by another
romantic adorer of the beautiful Diana. This shepherd,
whose love had always been unrequited, now joins his
lamentations to those of the once happy Sireno, and
each vies with the other in claiming to himself the
heaviest load of misery. They are joined by a shepherdess,
named Selvagia, who has been no less unfortunate
in love than themselves. She relates her history
very circumstantially, and thus terminates the first book.
In the second, the conversation of these lovers is continued,
until three nymphs appear, one of whom relates
Sireno’s history in a song of some length. Up to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
conclusion of this song, the pastoral simplicity of the
story is preserved uninterrupted by any incident approximating
to the terrible; but suddenly a party
of savage robbers completely armed appears. The
nymphs are about to fly, but are detained by the
robbers. A battle then ensues between the robbers
and the shepherds, the latter attacking the former with
stones. The robbers are on the point of overcoming
their rustic antagonists, when a heroine, habited as a
huntress, rushes from a wood, and bending her bow,
pierces the robbers with her arrows, and liberates the
nymphs. The fair huntress then joins the party of
nymphs and shepherds, and in her turn also relates
her history. This narrative, together with the conversations
and songs to which it gives rise, concludes
the second book. In the third book the story assumes
the character of a fairy tale. The nymphs lead their
protectress, together with the rest of the party, through
a thick forest to the castle of the wise Felicia, who is
represented as a kind of priestess to the goddess Diana.
The description of the wonders and magnificence of
the castle occupies a great portion of the third book.
The wise Felicia conducts the party to a superb hall
of state, where they behold a numerous collection of
majestic statues, representing Roman emperors, Castilian
knights, and Castilian ladies. Even a place is
found for the statue of a Moorish knight, of whose
conflicts with the Christians a long history is related
in this sanctuary of the goddess Diana. By means
of enchantment Felicia cures Sireno of the torments
of love. At length, in the sixth book, the poet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
releases his shepherds and shepherdesses from Felicia’s
palace, and the reader for the first time becomes
acquainted with the shepherdess Diana. She attaches
the blame of her infidelity to her parents, by whom,
during the absence of Sireno, she was forced to give
her hand to another. In the following scenes, to the
conclusion of the seventh book, where Montemayor’s
labour terminates, the history of the principal characters
makes no further progress. Some of the other
lovers in the romance are, however, united according to
their wishes.</p>

<p>This composition, in which it is easy to recognize
the uncultivated genius of a poet, who, to give vent to
the emotions of his soul, deemed it necessary to wander
through the whole region of romance, can only be
regarded by the unprejudiced critic as a fantastical
frame-work, serving to display pictures of the feelings
and a philosophy of the heart, which constitute the
prominent features of the whole poem. To paint romantic
fidelity under the most fascinating and various
forms, and at the same time to exhibit in a poetic
point of view the theory of that fidelity, which even
in a poem could only be verified by facts, was the idea
which guided Montemayor’s inventive fancy, and the
execution of which bears the full impression of his
genius. The versified portion of the romance is the
soul of the whole composition. A series of lyric poems,
partly in the Italian and partly in the old Castilian
style, are introduced; but these compositions are strikingly
distinguished from the eclogues of Saa de Miranda
by an epigrammatic poignancy, which frequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
degenerates into antiquated subtlety.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> But this epigrammatic
turn usually imparts a more pointed precision
to the lyrical expression, and a degree of consistency
to the whole composition, which in no way injures
its pastoral simplicity;<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> and when judged according to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
the characteristic form of the popular songs, called
<i>Villancicos</i>, it by no means presents, to Spaniards in
particular, the idea of too much refinement or incongruity
with rustic nature.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> In order to judge candidly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
of the pastoral truth of these compositions, it is necessary
to have the Spanish romantic ideas of nature
present to the mind. Montemayor is inexhaustible in
new turns and images for the expression of tenderness.
In depth of feeling he vies with Saa de Miranda;
and, though his poetry is occasionally deficient
in rhythmical polish, it in general presents so exquisite
a union of the grace of language, with a happy
concordance of ideas, that the reader must soon become
warmed by the spirit of the poet, even though he
should begin to peruse the work with indifference.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p>Montemayor’s style of romantic prose has been a
model for all writers of pastoral romances in the Spanish
language. How far he himself imitated the prose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
of Sanazzar, cannot easily be ascertained, as it is not
known whether or not Sanazzar’s Arcadia<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> was the prototype
of his Diana. Though it is certain that Montemayor
carefully endeavoured to give precision and dignity
of expression, and to impart harmony to every line
of his composition, his language nevertheless appears
neither laboured nor affected. His taste seems to have
been in only a few instances seduced by the influence of
that ostentatious solemnity, which distinguished the common
chivalrous romances, written in imitation of Amadis
de Gaul. In general he remained faithful to the dignified
simplicity, which the author of the Amadis appears
to have regarded as the genuine characteristic of
the lofty style of romantic prose. To this style his
protracted but rhythmically pleasing sentences may
justly be said to belong.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> It is but seldom that a low
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
expression escapes him.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> His descriptions are never
deficient in vividness and force.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> It is only in the
didactic passages in which he propounds his philosophy
of love, that his language becomes tinged with the
scholastic formality, which at the period in which he
wrote, was considered indispensable when any scholastic
ideas were to be expressed; for though Montemayor
had not received that kind of education, which in his
age was considered learned, he had picked up some
notions of the scholastic philosophy, which, when they
interested him, he was fond of introducing into the
romance of his heart.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>The other works of Montemayor, which are not so
celebrated as his Diana, are to be found in a collection
of his poems, which, according to the old custom, is
entitled a <i>Cancionero</i>.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<h3 id="HERRERA">HERRERA.</h3>

<p>Fernando de Herrera, a poet very different in character
from Montemayor, must next be included among
the authors who chiefly contributed to reform Castilian
poetry, during the first half of the sixteenth century.
Of the history of his life but little is known. He was
a native of Seville, and was born, according to the
conjectures of his Spanish biographers, about the commencement
of the sixteenth century. Thus he flourished
at the same time as Diego de Mendoza, and afforded
another instance of the light of poetical improvement
being directed from the south of Spain. It appears that
he did not enter into the ecclesiastical state, to which he
finally devoted himself, until he attained a mature age;
but he must have received a literary education, as he
possessed no ordinary knowledge of the ancient and
modern languages, geography, mathematics, and scholastic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
philosophy. According to a portrait which has
been preserved of him, he appears to have been a handsome
man; and some of the editors of his works alledge
that the lady whom he has celebrated in his
verses under various names, was not merely an ideal
object of the poet’s tenderness. The admirers of his
poetry have applied to him, after the Italian manner,
the surname of the <i>divine</i>; and this epithet, rendered
so equivocal by its application to Pietro Aretino, was
never bestowed on any other Spanish poet. These few
particulars are all that are known relative to the life of
Fernando de Herrera. He died at an advanced age,
probably soon after the year 1578.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>Why Herrera should have obtained the title of
divine, in preference to all the other poets of his
nation, would appear almost incomprehensible, were it
not known that two opposite parties vied with each
other in exalting him; and, to avoid the appearance of
yielding on either side, considered themselves reciprocally
bound to pronounce compositions sublime which
neither could regard as natural. Herrera was, notwithstanding,
a poet of powerful talent, and one who
evinced undaunted resolution in pursuing the new
path which he had struck out for himself. The novel
style, however, which he wished to introduce into
Spanish poetry, was not the result of a spontaneous essay,
flowing from immediate inspiration, but was theoretically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
constructed on artificial principles. Thus, amidst
traits of real beauty, his poetry every where presents
marks of affectation. The great fault of his language is
too much singularity; and his expression, where it ought
to be elevated, is merely far-fetched.</p>

<p>Herrera fancied he had discovered that the diction
of the Spanish poets, even in their best works, was too
common, too nearly allied to the language of prose, and
consequently very far removed from the classical dignity
which distinguishes the Greek and Roman poetry.
This opinion induced him to form for himself a new
style. He classed words according to his fancy, into
elegant and inelegant, and was careful to employ in his
verse only those to which he attributed the former character.
He connected words, under significations which
they do not bear in common language; and in contradistinction
to the spirit of prose, he regarded certain
repetitions, for example, the conjunction <i>and</i> as very
appropriate to poetry. He also introduced into his
verse, a free arrangement of words, after the model of
the latin construction. Finally, he thought he could
enrich the language of poetry by new words, which he
formed by analogy from existing Castilian words, or
adopted immediately from the latin.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> This peculiarity
of style was regarded as the perfection of poetry, by
the party who idolized Fernando de Herrera.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>Those, however, who have no inclination to confound
pompous with poetic language, or diction with
the essence of poetry, must still allow to Herrera the
possession of poetic ideas and precision of manner, as
well as a true dignity of expression, and an elegant
harmony of versification. His language is not always
affected, and his thoughts and descriptions, though frequently
overstrained, are never trivial.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> Notwithstanding
all the faults of his style, he must be accounted
the first classical ode writer in modern literature, for
the attempts of the Italian poet Chiabrera to emulate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
Pindar, are of more recent date; and here it is worthy
of remark, that the Spanish odes of Herrera and the
Italian odes of Chiabrera resemble each other in a
mixture of the style of the Pindaric ode, with the style
of the canzone. Through the medium of that lyric
form only, was the spirit of Pindar felt by these
imitators; and both were the more easily deceived, as
the genius of the Spanish and Italian languages has a
relation to the metrical structure of the canzone,
somewhat similar to that which the genius of the
Greek language bears to Pindaric verse. But the
rapid and bold succession of thoughts and images,
which animates the odes of Pindar, could not be imitated
by poets, who, even in their boldest flights of
fancy were bound down by the laws of the Italian canzone,
to the luxurious harmony of its protracted verbose
periods. Thus Herrera’s odes, like those of Chiabrera,
bear only a remote resemblance to their prototypes.
Odes, however, they must be termed, though Herrera
himself has classed them, under the general title of
<i>canciones</i>, along with imitations of the Italian style,
purely romantic, but versified according to similar rules.
In his celebrated odes on the battle of Lepanto, in
which the Spaniards under Don John of Austria, the
natural son of Charles V. obtained a brilliant victory
over the Turks, the magnificence of the rhythm would
be sufficiently attractive, though the ideas conveyed in
the torrent of sonorous syllables possessed less poetic
beauty than really belong to them.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> Occasionally,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
however, Herrera’s ideas degenerate into fantastical
hyperboles; for instance, when boasting of his hero, he
says, that Don John of Austria, that glorious conqueror
of the infidels and the elements, combines within
himself “whatever of heavenly power animates terrestrial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
bodies;” and that therefore “the fixed earth, the
extended waters, the circumambent air, and the ever
glowing flames depend on him, so that through the
secret control which he exercises over earth, water, air,
and fire, all these elements are his works.”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> But passages
of real beauty occur in Herrera’s odes, which
afford a sufficient compensation for this sort of bombast.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
Among the odes for which Herrera has chosen a softer
theme, the prize of superiority has been justly awarded
to the Ode to Sleep. It is one of those compositions
which may be said to be single in their kind. The
graceful choice of language, the picturesque effect, the
delicate keeping in the composition, and the finish
given to all the details in strict conformity with the
true spirit of the theme, impart to this ode or cancion
a lyric beauty which must render it in all ages an object
of admiration, not only to the lover, but to the
critic of poetry.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p>The other poems of Herrera, though extremely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
numerous, require only a slight notice.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> His best
sonnets, which are among the happiest imitations of Petrarch
in the Spanish language, are characterized by the
recurrence of some of the author’s favourite images, as
for example, the comparison of his mistress to light, or
the evening star,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> &amp;c. He is frequently very successful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
in the management of these similes; but at other times
he falls into strange absurdities, such as making the
“curling waves of gold of his sweet light float in the
wind.”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> But extravagant tropes of this kind could
not be very offensive to Spanish taste, which had been
accustomed to indulge the orientalisms of the old
national style, and they were indeed not only tolerated
but esteemed. It might have been expected that a
writer possessing so much critical judgment as Herrera,
would, as an imitator of Petrarch, have endeavoured to
naturalize in his native tongue, the simplicity of the
Italian poet; but he was too much a Spaniard to be
pleased with such simplicity. His elegies, and other
lyric compositions in the Italian syllabic measure, have
all the same character.</p>

<p>Herrera endeavoured, by other means than poetical
composition, to give to the national taste of the
Spaniards a direction conformable to his own principles.
He wrote a “Critical Commentary on the Poems of
Garcilaso de la Vega.”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> This commentary has served
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
as a model for many similar works, which have been
the means of circulating various kinds of useful knowledge
without having contributed in any remarkable
degree to the advancement of taste. Herrera, as a
theorist, failed to establish any fixed point or station
from which he might have taken a clear and consistent
view of the whole region of poetry. His criticism
everlastingly turns on detached ideas and words; and
whenever opportunities for displaying his learning occur,
he digresses into all the regions of philosophy and literature.
Of the indistinctness of his notions, relative
to the different species of poetry, some idea may be
formed from his definition of the elegy. He says&mdash;“an
elegy should be simple, soft, tender, amiable,
terse, clear, and if it may be so called, noble; affecting
to the feelings, and moving them in every way; neither
very inflated nor very humble, nor obscured by affected
phrases or far-fetched fables.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<h3 id="LUIS_DE_LEON">LUIS DE LEON.</h3>

<p>Luis Ponce de Leon, the next lyric poet to be
noticed, pursued a course very different from that of
Herrera, whose contemporary he was. He is usually
called, by abbreviation, merely Luis de Leon, and did
not obtain the surname of divine, to which, however,
he might have laid claim with infinitely more justice
than Herrera, if his pious humility would have permitted
him to entertain the idea of maintaining any
competition for earthly honours.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>This poet, who for classical purity of style and moral
dignity of ideas, had never been surpassed in Spanish
literature, was, like Herrera and Mendoza, a native of the
south of Spain. He was born at Granada, in the year
1527, where the family of the Ponces de Leon, which was
connected with the most distinguished of the Spanish nobility,
flourished. At an early period of life, Luis de
Leon felt a poetic inspiration, and cherished a love of
retirement, which rendered him indifferent to outward
show, and all the pleasures of the great world. He found
only in poetry and in the contemplation of a superior
existence that food for which his soul longed. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
tranquil and gentle mind exhibited none of the gloomy
features of monkish fanaticism, but was devoted to moral
and religious meditation. As soon as he had finished his
scholastic studies, he entered, of his own free choice, into
the ecclesiastical state. He was sixteen years of age
when he made his profession in the order of St. Augustine
at Salamanca. Theology now became his proper
occupation. In Spain, especially at that period, a man
of the character of Luis de Leon, even if he possessed
a mind capable of divesting itself of prejudice, could
scarcely be expected to doubt the dogmas of the catholic
faith; but his poetic imagination, which was not
to be satisfied with their dry and scholastic interpretation,
irresistibly impelled him to adorn them. Luis
transferred the mild enthusiasm of his pious feelings
into the theological studies, to which his vocation
devoted him. On religious subjects he was a learned
and diligent author; but his heart found, at least during
the first years of his monastic life, only in poetry,
the faithful interpreter of his love for that pure truth,
to the attainment of which all his arduous efforts were
directed. Though invested in his thirty-third year
with the dignity of doctor of theology, he maintained,
even within the cloister, his intimacy with the classic
writers of antiquity. The Hebrew poetry also worked
powerfully on his imagination; and on one occasion he
nearly fell a martyr to an attempt to translate and comment
on the Song of Solomon. He was very far from
wishing to give a too liberal interpretation of the
amatory language of the original. He explained the
sacred poem in perfect accordance with the sense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
attributed to it by the church. But the inquisition had,
at that time, strictly prohibited the translation of any
part of the bible into the vulgar tongue. Luis de Leon,
therefore, ventured to communicate his version in confidence
to one friend only; but that friend was not faithful
to his trust, and the translation found its way into the
hands of several individuals. It was soon denounced
to the inquisition, and the author was immediately
thrown into prison by that terrible tribunal. He himself
mentions, in one of his letters, that for the space of five
years he was deprived of all communication with mankind,
and was not even permitted to see the light of
day.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> Conscious of his innocence, he enjoyed during
his captivity, according to his own testimony, a
tranquillity and satisfaction of mind which he never
afterwards so fully experienced, when restored to
freedom, and the society of his friends.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> At length
justice was done to him, he returned in triumph to his
monastery, and was reinstated in his ecclesiastical
dignities. From that period, he appears to have been
wholly devoted to the duties of his order and the study
of theology. He died in 1591, in the sixty-fourth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
year of his age, being at that time general and provincial
vicar of Salamanca.</p>

<p>The poems of this amiable enthusiast are, according
to his own testimony,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> for the most part the
productions of his youth; but no other Spanish poet has
succeeded in expressing the intense feelings of the heart
under the control of so sound a judgment. It is only by
reference to the pious tranquillity of a cultivated mind
wrapt up in self communion, that the extraordinary correctness
of this author’s style can be explained, for Luis
de Leon is, without exception, the most correct of all
the Spanish poets, though he constantly regarded the
metrical clothing of his ideas as a very secondary object.
To use his own language, he wrote poetry rather in
fulfilment of his destiny, than purposely and by dint of
study. At an early age he became intimately acquainted
with the odes of Horace, and the elegance and purity of
style which distinguish those compositions made a deep
impression on his imagination. Classical simplicity and
dignity were the models constantly present to his creative
fancy. He, however, appropriated to himself the
character of Horace’s poetry, too naturally ever to incur
the danger of servile imitation. He discarded the prolix
style of the canzone, and imitated the brevity of the
strophes of Horace, in romantic syllabic measures and
rhymes. More just feeling for the imitation of the
ancients was never evinced by any modern poet. His
odes have, however, a character totally different from
those of Horace, though the sententious air which marks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
the style of both authors, imparts to them a deceptive
resemblance. The religious austerity of Luis de Leon’s
life was not to be reconciled with the epicurism of the
latin poet; but, notwithstanding this very different disposition
of the mind, it is not surprising that they
should have adopted the same form of poetic expression,
for each possessed a fine imagination, subordinate to the
control of a sound understanding. Which of the two
is the superior poet, in the most extended sense of the
word, it would be difficult to determine, as each formed
his style by free imitation, and neither overstepped the
boundaries of a certain sphere of practical observation.
Horace’s odes exhibit a superior style of art, and from
the relationship between the thoughts and images, possess
a degree of attraction which is wanting in those of
Luis de Leon; but on the other hand, the latter are the
more rich in that natural kind of poetry, which may be
regarded as the overflowing of a pure soul, elevated to
the loftiest regions of moral and religious idealism.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>Luis de Leon himself published a collection of his
poetic works, divided into three books. The first,
contains his original poems&mdash;the second, translations
from some of the ancient classics&mdash;and the third, metrical
versions of several of the psalms, and some parts
of the book of Job.</p>

<p>The reader who peruses the poems of Luis de Leon,
which are all odes, in the spirit in which the author
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
wrote them, will fancy himself transported to a better
world. No furious zeal disturbs the gentle piety that
pervades them; no extravagant metaphor destroys the
harmony of the ideas and expression; and no discordant
accent breaks the pleasing melody of the rhythm. The
idea of the perishableness of all earthly things,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> is
united with smiling pictures of nature.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> The imitations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
of Horace are only introduced to aid the poetic
light in which the poet views those objects which were
peculiarly interesting to his contemporaries.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> One of
Luis de Leon’s most celebrated odes is the <i>Noche
Serena</i>, but the concluding stanzas do not correspond
with the beauty of the commencement.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> In the ode
to Felipe Ruiz, the ardent aspiration for heavenly truth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
is very picturesquely expressed.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> But the exalted inspiration
and tender enthusiasm in which Luis de Leon
so widely departs from Horace, are most prominently
evinced in his ode on Heavenly Life (<i>De la Vida del
Cielo</i>). Here his fancy is bold without launching into extravagant
metaphors. What an etherial effulgence glows
through his lyric picture of “the soft bright region,
the meadow of holiness, never blighted by frost, nor
withered by the sun’s rays;&mdash;where the good shepherd,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
his head crowned with blossoms of purple and white,
without either sling or staff, leads his beloved flock to
the sweet pasture covered with everblooming roses;&mdash;where
the shepherd, reclining in the shade at noon,
blows his heavenly pipe, whose feeblest tone, should it
descend on the ear of the poet, would transform his
whole soul to love.”<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> The ode in which the genius of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
the Tagus prophecies to King Roderick the misfortunes
of Spain, is more in Horace’s style, and possesses a very
happy uniformity of character. In some other imitations
of a similar kind, the fancy of the pious poet
willingly descends from the heavenly regions. The
poems contained in the first part of the collection are
few in number. Those which Luis de Leon himself
inserted, amount only to twenty-seven, and among them
is an indifferent elegy, and a cancion in the Italian
style of not much greater merit. Several other compositions,
which he seems to have rejected, have been
recently printed from manuscripts.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>The greater portion of the poetic works of Luis
de Leon consists of translations; but these translations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
form an epoch in the department of literature to which
they belong. Those in the second book of the collection
are the first classical specimens, in modern literature,
of the art of renewing the ancient poetry in
modern forms. Luis de Leon has himself explained
the principles by which he was guided in bringing the
ancient poetry within the sphere of the romantic. He
endeavoured to make the ancient poets speak, “as they
would have expressed themselves, had they been born
in his own age in Castile, and had they written in Castilian.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a>
However bold this attempt may appear, and
whatever defects a translation of this kind may present
to the eye of the connoisseur who wishes for a faithful
resemblance of the original, and not a flowery imitation,
yet if the validity of the principle be once admitted,
Luis de Leon will be found to have fulfilled all that the
most rigid critic can desire. Besides, it must be considered
that translations of a more literal character
would scarcely have found readers in Spain at that
period. Luis de Leon translated Virgil’s eclogues, partly
in tercets, and partly in coplas;<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> a considerable series
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
of Horace’s odes in the same romantic syllabic measure
which he chose for his own odes;<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>&mdash;and a portion of
Virgil’s georgics in stanzas. But the easy flowing style
of his Spanish version of Pindar’s first ode, excels all
the rest.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> To these translations are also added two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
imitations of Italian sonnets, which prove that he
succeeded very well in that species of composition,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
though among his own original poems there is not a
single sonnet. He translated the psalms of David,
according to the rule he had prescribed to himself.
His translations speedily obtained the rank in
Spanish literature to which they were entitled; and
they have served as models for all succeeding versions
of Greek and Latin poetry in the Spanish language.
Luis de Leon may indeed be blamed for having
thwarted, by the style of translation which he introduced,
all the attempts made to form Spanish poetry
on the model of that of the ancients. But on the other
hand, to his example the Spaniards are indebted for
numerous translations of Greek and Latin poetry, which
have all the air of Spanish originals.</p>

<p>If Luis de Leon had not confined his prose writings
exclusively to spiritual subjects, he would doubtless have
also exercised a very decided influence on the rhetorical
cultivation of Spain. His sermons (<i>oraciones</i>) are,
however, invariably mentioned in terms of praise by
Spanish writers, whenever they allude to the theological
literature of their country.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> Among his other works
intended for edification, The Woman as she should be,
or The Perfect Wife, (<i>La Perfecta Casada</i>), will perhaps
be found the most interesting to the untheological
class of readers; though it constantly turns on the
positive morality of Catholicism, and therefore, like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
every mixed treatise of theology and morals, is no legitimate
specimen of the developement of ideas in the
didactic style.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p>Luis de Leon terminates the series of distinguished
Spanish authors, who during the first half of the sixteenth
century, composed after the model of the great
poets of Italy, or the ancient classics, and who, by the
superiority of their genius, mainly contributed to give
a new character to Spanish poetry. There are, however
others, whose poetic works ought not to be passed
over in silence; but to follow the example of those
writers, who have hitherto related the history of Spanish
poetry, without separating subordinate from eminent
talent, would be to prolong an act of injustice. At
the same time to the continuation which must be made
of the history of the lyric and pastoral poetry of Spain,
during the first half of the sixteenth century, may be
very properly added some account of a few unsuccessful
efforts in epic composition, and a notice of the
further progress of the old national poetry during the
same period.</p>

<h3 id="MINOR_SPANISH_POETS">MINOR SPANISH POETS DURING THE PERIOD OF
THIS SECTION, VIZ. ACUÑA&mdash;CETINA&mdash;PADILLA&mdash;GIL
POLO.</h3>

<p>Fernando de Acuña, one of the first of the distinguished
men who became the disciples of Boscan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
and Garcilaso, was of Portuguese extraction, but born
in Madrid, probably about the beginning of the sixteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> He signalized himself in the campaigns of
Charles V. and was also a person of consideration at
the court of that monarch. He lived on terms of
intimate friendship with Garcilaso de la Vega, whom
he survived for a considerable period, for it appears
that his death did not take place until the year 1580.
He proved his taste for classical literature by translations
and imitations. He paraphrased in iambic blank
verse, several passages from Ovid’s Metamorphoses,
and among the rest, the dispute between Ajax and
Ulysses for the arms of Achilles, in very correct and
harmonious language. He likewise translated some
of the Heroides of the same author in tercets. In his
own sonnets, cancions, and elegies, which are replete
with sentiment and grace, it is easy to recognise a poet
who successfully laboured to attain classical elegance
of style.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> He was also one of the first poets, who, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
composing in short strophes, endeavoured to form an
intermediate style between the Italian canzone and
the Spanish cancion.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<p>Gutierre de Cetina is less known, though there is
no doubt of his having lived about the same period, as
he is mentioned by Herrera in his Commentary on the
Works of Garcilaso. He was, like Herrera, a native of
Seville; and having removed to Madrid, was there
invested with an ecclesiastical dignity. Few of his
poems have been printed;<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> but from those few it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
obvious that he had a fair chance of becoming the
Anacreon of Spain. That glory, however, was reserved
for Villegas. Still Gutierre de Cetina’s imitations
of the anacreontic style are not without their
share of sweetness and grace; and they are moreover
remarkable as being the first productions in the class
to which they belong.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> His madrigals also seem to
have had no prototype in Spanish literature.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> In his
canciones, however, the romantic enthusiasm occasionally
degenerates into absurdity.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>Pedro do Padilla, a knight of the spiritual order
of St. Jago, must be ranked in the same class with
Gutierre. He vied with Garcilaso in pastoral poetry;
and in order to conciliate the partizans of both the old
and the new styles, he introduced alternately in the same
eclogue the Italian and the ancient Spanish metres.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>
His poetry is still esteemed in Spain. He followed the
old national custom by making the events connected
with the war in the Netherlands serve as subjects for
romances.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p>But a poet still more celebrated, and in a great
degree indebted for his fame to the immoderate encomium
bestowed upon him by the pen of Cervantes, is
Gaspar Gil Polo, a native of Valencia, who continued and
concluded Montemayor’s Diana under the title of <i>La</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
<i>Diana enamorada</i>.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> A continuation of this pastoral
romance had previously been undertaken by a writer
named Perez; but without success. Gil Polo in one respect
effected more than did Montemayor himself; but
in point of invention he is inferior, notwithstanding the
faults of the original plan. After Sireno has been cured
of his love by the sage Felicia, Gil Polo makes the passion
of Diana revive, and renders her more unhappy for Sireno’s
sake, than he had previously been for hers. Thus
the romantic story is reversed; but the new relations
under which it now appears are few. In the sequel the
aid of the sage Felicia is again obtained, and she finally
unites the long separated lovers. The narrative style
in the prose portion of the romance presents a very
correct imitation of Montemayor; but neither the merit
of this imitation, nor the continuation of the metaphysical
reflections on love, with which the romance is
interspersed, would have gained for Gil Polo the approbation
of the critic. What must have raised him
higher than Montemayor in the estimation of such a
judge as Cervantes, is the precision and clearness of
the ideas, and the perfect polish of style in the poetic
part of the romance. Montemayor has often indulged
in too subtle or sophistical plays of wit. Gil Polo in
painting the feelings has exercised a sounder judgment,
without, however, descending to the coldness of prose.
His sonnets may be regarded as models; for he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
succeeded in combining the unity of ideas, which ought
to distinguish that species of composition, with the most
elegant rounding and regularity of structure.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> In his
canciones he has occasionally, for the sake of variety,
imitated the Provençal rhymes (<i>rimas Provenzales</i>)
with such happy dexterity, that the reader might fancy
himself perusing some of the best opera songs, though no
such thing as an opera then existed.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> In like manner,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
he endeavoured to naturalize the metrical structure of
French verse (<i>rimas Franceses</i>) in the Spanish language,
upon which the burthen of alexandrines had
already been inflicted.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> In compliment to the old
Spanish taste, he bedecked his romance with a profusion
of versified riddles (<i>preguntas</i>,) which are, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
the most part, so exceedingly dull, that it is difficult to
conceive how they could be endured by a man of Gil
Polo’s talent.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> In honour of Valencia, his native city,
he composed a poem, in which the genius of the little
river Turia is made to sing the praises of the celebrated
men to whom Valencia had given birth. This song of
Turia (<i>Canto de Turia</i>) has found patriotic commentators,
without whose laborious explanations it would
have been unintelligible to foreign readers.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<h3 id="OBSTACLES_TO_THE_IMITATION">OBSTACLES TO THE IMITATION OF THE ROMANTIC
EPOPEE IN SPAIN&mdash;UNSUCCESSFUL ESSAYS
IN SERIOUS EPOPEE&mdash;TRANSLATIONS OF CLASSICAL
EPIC POETRY.</h3>

<p>Though Spanish literature was in the manner just
recorded, enriched during half a century by numerous
lyric and pastoral compositions, which deserve to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
handed down with honour to posterity, yet within the
same interval epic poetry made but little advancement
in Spain.</p>

<p>Early in this period the absurd name of idyls
(<i>idyllios</i>) appears to have been applied to such narrative
poems as were not romances, and to have marked
out a particular field for a kind of poetic tales, which
were in some measure imitations from the ancients, and
yet were executed in the romantic style. Such, for
example, was Boscan’s free translation of the story of
Hero and Leander from Musæus, which the Spaniards
call their first idyl. Thus the term idyls in Spanish,
conveys no idea of pastoral poems, which are always
called eclogues (<i>eglogas</i>.)<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> Castillejo, of whom further
mention will shortly be made, imitated in old Castilian
verse, stories from Ovid, and gave to them the name
of idyls. The spurious heroic style which the authors
of these tales introduced, proved, without doubt, one
of the obstacles to the cultivation of chivalrous epic
poetry in Spain; but it is also to be recollected, that
the luxuriant mixture of the comic with the serious,
which is the very soul of the romantic epopee of the
Italians, was by no means congenial to Spanish taste.
In Spain the works of Boyardo and Ariosto were
known only through the medium of bad translations,
and were read merely with the interest attached to all
books of chivalry. Finally, the spirit of the old romance
poetry was also hostile to the chivalric epopee.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
To descend from the cordial gravity of the national narrative
romances, to the careless levity with which the
venerable heroes of chivalry were treated by the Italian
writers, was a transition repugnant to the patriotic
feelings of the Spaniards; who, in their wars with the
Italians, were the more disposed to be proud of the
preservation of their national spirit of chivalry, when
they found that it facilitated their victories over men who
were better fitted for intrigue than for defending their
freedom sword in hand. Thus, to the chivalrous epopee
of the Italians, the Spaniards remained as completely
strangers, as if they had been excluded from all opportunity
of becoming acquainted with that kind of composition;
and yet the period when the Spaniards and
Italians maintained the closest political and literary
relations, precisely corresponds with that of Ariosto’s
first celebrity, and of the numerous imitations of the
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>, which appeared in the Italian language.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>On the contrary, several Spanish poets, during the
first half of the sixteenth century, zealously competed
for the palm in the serious epopee; but obstacles again
arose, which all the force of Spanish genius was not
sufficient to surmount. Torquato Tasso had not yet
shewn what the serious epic was capable of becoming,
and what it must be, in order to be reconciled to the
taste of modern times. The Spaniards were so little
prepared for the new poetry with which they had
suddenly been made acquainted on the first imitation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
of the Italian style, that they could not be expected to
enter without a guide into the true spirit of the modern
epopee. The men, who at this time boldly attempted
to become the Homers of their country, appear to
have felt that they could not select from ancient
history the materials for an epic poem. But on the
other hand, their patriotic feelings prepossessed them
too much in favour of events of recent occurrence.
The age in which they themselves lived was, in their
eyes, the most illustrious and the most worthy of epic
glory; a Spanish Homer could record no achievements
save those of the Spaniards under Charles V.; and the
hero, who in their poems eclipsed all others, was their
favourite Charles, the never conquered, (<i>el nunca vencido</i>,)
as he was styled by all the Spanish writers of
the sixteenth century. Thus arose the <i>Caroliads</i>, or
heroic poems, in praise of Charles V. all of which
speedily sunk into oblivion. Among them were the
<i>Carlos Famoso</i>, by Luis de Zapata; the <i>Carlos Victorioso</i>,
by Geronymo de Urrea; <i>La Carolea</i>, by the Valencian
poet, Geronymo Sampèr, &amp;c. Alonzo Lopez,
surnamed Pinciano, who flourished at the commencement
of the sixteenth century, was more happy in his
choice of an epic subject. The hero of his story is
Pelayo, the brave descendant of the visigothic kings,
who, in his turn, was the first to subdue the Arabs.
But Pinciano’s poem, which he entitled <i>El Pelayo</i>,
had no better fate than the Caroliads.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<p>The present seems a fit opportunity for mentioning
<i>La fuente de Alcover</i>, a narrative poem, which though
of humbler pretensions than the Caroliads, experienced
considerable success. The author, Felipe Mey, who was
of Flemish extraction, was a bookseller in Valencia.
Encouraged by his patron, Antonio Agustin, bishop of
Tarragona, he chose a few stanzas, written by that ingenious
prelate, as the ground work of a mythological
poem. The idea originated in the name given to
a plant (<i>capillus veneris</i>), through which the water
trickling drop by drop, at length forms a little fountain.
This pretty poem makes, along with some others
by Felipe Mey, an appendix to his unfinished translation
of <i>Ovid’s Metamorphoses</i> in octave verse. It deserves
also to be mentioned, that this translation reads
like a modern poem; both language and versification
are excellent.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p>Some other translations of the ancient classic poets
which appeared, during this period, remain to be noticed.
Gonzalo Perez, a native of Arragon, is the author of a
poetic translation of Homer’s Odyssey, in the Castilian
language. The first edition was printed in 1552, and
the second in 1562; so that it seems the Spanish public
felt an interest in this extension of their poetic literature.
Gregorio Fernandez translated the Æneid and
several of Virgil’s eclogues in verse; and in the like
manner Juan de Guzman executed a complete version
of the georgics. All these translations, however, like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
those of Luis de Leon, must be regarded as re-casts of
ancient materials into modern moulds, rather than
translations, in the strict sense of the term. But, in
an age and country, in which both the people and the
language were imbued with the spirit of the romantic
poetry, to have attempted to introduce the classic poets
of Greece or Rome in any other way than in a romantic
dress, would have been to do violence to the genius of
the language and the nation.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<h3 id="PROGRESS_OF_THE_ROMANTIC_POETRY">PROGRESS OF THE ROMANTIC POETRY&mdash;CASTILLEJO:
HIS CONTEST WITH THE PARTIZANS OF THE
ITALIAN STYLE.</h3>

<p>The rapid success of the imitators of the Italian
and classic styles, did not, however, deprive the old
romance poetry of its rank, either in literature or in
public estimation. The first half of the sixteenth century,
was doubtless the period when most of the old
romances, then first brought together in collections,
received the form which they have retained down to
the present day; and, in all probability, not less than
half the romances and canciones collected in the <i>Romanceros
generales</i>, particularly the mythological, anacreontic,
and comic kinds, had no existence previous to
that period.</p>

<p>But no poet of that age defended the cause of the
old Castilian poetry, in all its various forms, with so
much talent and zeal as Christoval de Castillejo, the
most illustrious of the literary opponents of the Italian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
style. Castillejo obtained the post of secretary in
the service of the Emperor Ferdinand I. an appointment
which was a consequence of the relations still subsisting
between the courts of Madrid and Vienna, after
the death of Charles V. notwithstanding that the German
empire was then separated from the Spanish monarchy.
The greater part of Castillejo’s poems were
written in Vienna; and are full of allusions to the gay
sphere of life in which he moved at the imperial court.
A young German lady, named Schomburg, of whom he
seems to have been an ardent admirer, figures in his
poems, under the name of Xomburg, because nothing like
the hissing sound of the German <i>sch</i>, could be expressed
by the same characters in the Castilian language. Advanced
in life, and tired of gallantry and the gay world,
he returned to Spain, became a Cistercian monk, and died
in a convent in 1596. The admirers of Castillejo<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> assign
to him the first rank among Spanish poets; but the
unprejudiced critic cannot, in justice, elevate him to so
high a station. His poetic horizon was very limited.
He was determined to be nothing but an old Castilian
in poetic taste, as in every thing else. He ridiculed
Boscan, Garcilaso, and all the Spanish poets of the new
party, with more wit than judgment.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> He asserted,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
though without foundation, that the old Castilian metres
and forms of rhyme were alone suited to the Castilian
language; and for want of better arguments to urge
against the amatory poetry of Italy, he asserted that
all poetry of love was to be regarded as mere raillery,
without reflecting, that in supporting this opinion he
cast more reproach on the old Spaniards than on the
Italians.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> The structure of Italian verse appeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
constrained to a poet, who confounded rapidity with
facility of style. The loose rhythm of the redondillas,
was with him an exclusive beauty of the syllabic structure
of his mother tongue, for he had no taste for a
more regular style of poetry; and some of his happiest
productions are limited merely to graceful plays of the
imagination. His fertility in these sports of fancy,
could not fail to obtain for him the esteem of his countrymen,
who were ever too ready to tolerate, and even
to admire, the subtle twisting of quaint and fanciful
conceits; but of all other poetic faults, most reluctant
to pardon heaviness of manner, particularly in versification.</p>

<p>Some of Castillejo’s canciones are, however, so exquisite,
that it is scarcely possible to resist the temptation
of placing their author in the very foremost rank
of poets.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> But in spite of his captivating fluency of style
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
and power of expression, most of his works bear traces
of a mental boundary which every great poet oversteps.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
A sort of affected verbosity often usurps the place of
real wit, particularly in his longer poems; and it not
unfrequently happens that whole pages of Castillejo’s
flowing verse are to the reader nothing more than
lively prose. The strong inclination to levity, which
he cannot resist, even when he wishes to be serious, is
a distinguishing feature in all the poetic essays of this
ingenious author, who has thus sometimes given to his
works more of a French than a Spanish character.</p>

<p>Castillejo arranged his lyric works in three books,
and they are so printed under the title of <i>Obras
Liricas</i>. Only a small portion of these poems, however,
properly belongs to the lyric class;<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> and the author
doubtless collected them together, under this general
title, for the purpose of distinguishing them from his
comedies, which are but little known. The first book
contains amatory poems, (<i>Obras amatorias</i>), songs,
jests, epistles, glosses after the old fashion, and in conclusion,
a piece which he styled a (<i>Capitulo</i>) on love.
The songs, for the most part, commence in a serious
tone,<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> but speedily assume a comic turn, with which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
they usually conclude.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> Some are burlesque parodies
on the affected ecstasies and extravagant metaphors of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
the Spanish sonnet writers. Such, for example, is the
“Tower of Lamentation,” or the “Wind Tower,”
(<i>Torre de Viento</i>,) which is supposed to be built entirely
of lovers’ sighs. Some shorter poems, in the
madrigal style, are among the best in this first book.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a>
There is also an “Exclamatory Epistle,” (<i>Epistola Exclamatoria</i>,)
the spirit and style of which are sufficiently
indicated by the title. Among the popular verses which
the playful humour of Castillejo prompted him to gloss
in the form of <i>Villancicos</i>, is one which merely says,
“If you tend my cows, my love, I will give you a kiss;
but give me a kiss and I will tend yours.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Productions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
of this description found favour with the readers for
whom they were intended. His humorous poems,
which are all more or less disguised under an air of
seriousness, contain a tale (<i>historia</i>) imitated from
Ovid, which may be called an idyl according to the
literary terminology of the Spaniards. The second book
contains conversational and diverting pieces, (<i>obras de
conversacion y de pasatiempo</i>.) At the commencement
appear the railleries of Castillejo against the
Petrarchists. The longest poem in this book is a
Dialogue on Women, (<i>Dialogo de la Condicion de las
Mugeres</i>,) which is here and there enlivened by admirable
sallies of wit;<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> but upon the whole it is nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
more than burlesque prose ideas dressed in easy verse.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a>
The third book, which contains moral works, (<i>obras
morales</i>,) is most prolix of all. The satires contained in
this third book have certainly a moral tendency, though
that object is in a great measure defeated by Castillejo’s
sportive style. The moral is lost in a torrent of words,
while the serious thoughts of which the verse is the vehicle,
are for the most part trivial.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> Notwithstanding the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
moral design of this third book, the Spanish inquisition
was for some time undecided with respect to its fate.
The publication of all the poems of Castillejo was
prohibited; but after some further deliberation the
inquisition permitted the sale of an edition, after it
had undergone a rigid revisal by the censor.</p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_OF_SPANISH_DRAMATIC_POETRY">HISTORY OF SPANISH DRAMATIC POETRY, DURING
THE FIRST HALF AND TEN SUCCEEDING YEARS
OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

<p>In the reign of Charles V. amidst a throng of
diversified talent, and during the conflict between the
old and new poetic styles, the Spanish drama began to
flourish. Considered in a literary point of view, it can
scarcely be said to have existed before that period; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
it arose under happier auspices than those which about
the same period accompanied the birth of the Italian
drama, to which the struggle between the learned and
the popular burlesque styles afforded less hope of success.
The sacred and profane pastoral dialogues of Juan
de la Enzina were, at the commencement of the sixteenth
century, still the only dramatic compositions in
the Spanish language, to which any degree of literary
respect was attached, and they were, by especial favour,
allowed to be performed at court.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> With the
exception of mysteries, spiritual moralities, and burlesque
representations of religious ceremonies, the
Spanish nation, at this time, knew nothing of dramatic
entertainments. No poet of reputation had hitherto
devoted his attention to this species of composition; but
the nation evinced by its attachment to those rude
exhibitions, that tenacity which is a great feature in its
character, and which even in matters of taste permits
no reform to take place which does not perfectly accord
with the inclination of the public. This constancy
of the national character must never for a moment be
lost sight of, while tracing the history of the Spanish
drama; but even with this peculiar circumstance carefully
kept in view, it is still impossible to give a very
satisfactory account of the early progress of dramatic
poetry among the Spaniards; for the notices which must
be resorted to for that purpose, are both defective and
confused.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<p>It is above all things necessary to begin by distinguishing
the three or four parties, which on totally
different principles endeavoured to cultivate dramatic
poetry in Spain, and which appear to have been
hitherto overlooked by the writers on Spanish literature,
merely because each of those parties pursued
its object, without openly declaring war against the
others. Critical cultivation was not yet so far advanced
in Spain as to open a field for literary warfare. But
the heterogeneous nature of the Spanish dramas of the
first half and ten following years of the sixteenth century,
renders it evident, on a very slight examination,
that the authors who composed them must have been
influenced by different views.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p id="THE_ERUDITE_PARTY">The party called the erudite, was the first which
at that period laboured to introduce into Spain a style
of dramatic literature, worthy to be called national.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
This party consisted of men of information and taste,
though possessing but little knowledge of the true art
of dramatic poetry, and still less of imagination. These
men, like a similar party in Italy, endeavoured to form
the modern drama on the model of the antique. As,
however, the most zealous among them did not possess
sufficient talent to imitate the ancient models, they
began to translate them, and performed their task in
prose. A Spanish translation of the Amphitryon of
Plautus, by Villalobos, physician to Charles V. was
printed in 1515. Shortly afterwards there appeared
a new translation of the same drama, by Perez de
Oliva, a prose writer of considerable merit, who will
be further noticed in the course of this history. Perez
de Oliva even ventured to make a prose version of the
Electra of Sophocles. This unfortunate attempt appeared
under the title of <i>La Venganza de Agamemnon</i>.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a>
He also translated the Hecuba of Euripides. At
a somewhat later period the Portuguese comedies of
Vasconcellos, written in the manner of Plautus, were
published in the Castilian language. Translations of
several comedies of Plautus subsequently appeared, and
at length Pedro Simon de Abril published a complete
translation of Terence, which is still much esteemed by
the Spaniards.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> Thus it was not the fault of the erudite
party that the Spanish drama did not resemble the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
ancient. But to introduce in Spain the tragic style of
the classic drama, in all its poetic purity, or even the
style of the ancient comedies in iambic verse, was
an idea which could only have originated with scholars
who did not understand the character of the Spanish
public. The translators, therefore, even those who
endeavoured to conciliate the public taste by prose versions,
formed, with their learned friends, a solitary party.
No first rate poet arose in Spain, like Ariosto in Italy,
to amuse and instruct the public by original dramatic
compositions on the classic model. It is possible that
essays in the ancient manner may have been performed
on some Spanish stage, particularly at Seville, but they
are now totally lost; and no attempt seems ever to
have been made to represent Spanish translations of
Greek and Latin plays.</p>

<p id="THE_PARTY_OF_THE_DRAMATIC_MORALISTS">The party of the dramatic moralists approximated
the closest to that which has just been described. The
interlocutory romance of Cœlestina,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> or Calistus and
Melibœa, poor in invention, but possessing in its natural
descriptions of common life, an attraction for many
readers, was, on account of its moral tendency, admired
as a master-piece of dramatic art. As this dramatic
romance was called a comedy or tragi-comedy, some
of its admirers conceived themselves bound to write
comedies and tragi-comedies in the same style for
the moral benefit of society. Whether these productions
were, or were not, calculated for representation,
seems never to have been a subject of consideration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
with their authors. They were content if
the scenes which they strung together exhibited in natural
language the lowest pictures of common life, and
forcibly marked the dangers attendant on vice. To do
this requires only an ordinary share of talent, and
accordingly Cœlestina was followed by a torrent of
similar “Mirrors of Sin” in the Castilian language.
The greater number appeared during the first half of
the sixteenth century, or shortly afterwards; and among
them were <i>Policiana</i>, entitled a tragedy;<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> <i>Perseus and
Tibaldea</i>, a comedy; <i>De la hechicera</i> (of the Witch),
a comedy; <i>Florinea</i>, a comedy, &amp;c. The author of a
work of this kind, entitled <i>La Doleria del Sueño del
Mundo</i>, (the Anguish of the Sleep of the World,)
mentions in his title-page, that it is a comedy in the
style of philosophic morality, (<i>Comedia tratada por via
de philosophia moral</i>.) All these insipid moral lessons
were read and admired in their day; but their extreme
length prevented them from getting possession of the
stage.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<p id="THE_FIRST_NATIONAL_PARTY">Equally removed from the moral and the erudite
party, was Bartholomè Torres Naharro, a man doubtless
of extraordinary talent. He was the founder of a third
party, which uniting with a fourth, that had for a short
interval preceded it, ultimately triumphed as the only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
national party, and obtained exclusive control over the
Spanish drama. It is a singular circumstance, and yet
one to which the historians of Spanish literature have
not called the attention of their readers, that Cervantes
in his comic sketch of the early History of the Spanish
Drama, mentions not a syllable respecting Torres Naharro,
while the editor of Cervantes’s comedies, who
has prefixed to them that sketch, declares, in his preface,
Torres Naharro to be the real inventor of the forms of
the Spanish comedy. Torres Naharro was born in the
little town of Torre, on the Portuguese frontiers, and
flourished in the beginning of the sixteenth century.
Of the history of his life but little is known. All
accounts, however, agree in describing him to have
been an ecclesiastic and a man of learning. After a
shipwreck which involved him in various adventures, he
arrived at Rome during the pontificate of Leo X. In
that friend of genius he found a distinguished patron.
It is, however, extremely improbable, that his comedies
were performed before the pope at Rome, though such
an assertion has been made by Spanish writers, and
has given offence to some Italians. It is certainly by no
means likely, that an occurrence so unusual, should
have escaped the notice of all Italian authors; and
Pope Leo can scarcely be supposed to have had any
strong inducement to study the Spanish language which
is not agreeable to Italian ears. It is more probable
that Naharro’s comedies were represented in Naples,
for there a Spanish audience was to be found; and
Naharro himself proceeded to Naples when the difficulties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
into which his satirical writings involved him,
obliged him to quit Rome.</p>

<p>The above are the only particulars that can be
obtained respecting the life of this extraordinary man;
and it is not certain how far they can be relied on, as
they are gathered from writers who do not mention the
sources from whence they derived their information.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a>
It is not improbable that Naharro’s comedies were
performed only in Naples, and not in Spain, where
there was no theatre suited to their representation; for
according to the account of Cervantes, who speaks as
an eye-witness, the whole apparatus of a Spanish
theatre, about the middle of the sixteenth century,
consisted of a few boards and benches, and a wardrobe,
and decorations, which were contained in a sack.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been the fate of the comedies
of Naharro, with respect to the stage in Spain,
they were certainly printed along with the other poetic
works of the author, in the year 1521, or at latest in
1533, under the learned title of <i>Propaladia</i>, intended
to signify exercises in the school of Pallas.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> Judging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
from the accounts given of these dramas by various
writers, there is very little doubt that Torres Naharro
was the real inventor of the Spanish comedy. He not
only wrote his eight comedies in redondillas in the romance
style, but he also endeavoured to establish the
dramatic interest solely on an ingenious combination of
intrigues, without attaching much importance to the
developement of character, or the moral tendency of
the story. It is besides probable, that he was the first
who divided plays into three acts, which being regarded
as three days labour in the dramatic field, were called
<i>jornadas</i>.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> It must, therefore, be unreservedly admitted,
that these dramas, considered both with respect
to their spirit and their form, deserve to be ranked as
the first in the history of the Spanish national drama;
for in the same path which Torres Naharro first trod,
the dramatic genius of Spain advanced to the point attained
by Calderon, and the nation tolerated no dramas
except those which belonged to the style which had
thus been created.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<p id="THE_SECOND_NATIONAL_PARTY">It would appear, however, that there was something
in the plays of Naharro which did not precisely harmonize
with the taste of the Spanish public, for they
were banished from literature and thrown into oblivion
by the prose dramas which Cervantes saw represented
in his youth. The author of these pieces, in which
songs are sometimes episodically introduced, was Lope
de Rueda, a native of Seville. This man, who was a
gold-beater by trade, and who had received no literary
education, was notwithstanding endowed with a strong
genius for the dramatic art. Cervantes styles him the
great Lope de Rueda. He did not compose his plays
in the character of an author. He was at the head of
a little company of players of whom he was himself
the ablest; and his own taste and that of the public
required only such pieces as could be easily represented
on his wretched stage which consisted merely of a few
planks of wood. The most prominent characters in
Lope de Rueda’s dramatic compositions, were those
which the author himself performed, and which, according
to the testimony of Cervantes, he delineated
in a highly natural style. In fools, roguish servants,
biscayan boors, and such like characters, he particularly
excelled. He did not neglect to avail himself of the
accidental union of the Spanish drama with pastoral
poetry, and he wrote some pastoral dialogues (<i>coloquios
pastoriles</i>) in prose. On this account his theatrical
wardrobe, of which Cervantes gives a humorous description,
contained four shepherds dresses of white fur,
trimmed with gold, an equal number of wigs and
shepherds crooks, and likewise four beards. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
beards, it would appear were indispensable in comedies
of every kind; and the public became so accustomed to
call an old man’s part in comedy the <i>beard</i>, that the
theatrical term <i>barba</i> was retained even after the
custom of wearing beards had long been exploded
from the stage.</p>

<p>Juan Timoneda has made careful collections of the
comedies and pastoral dramas of Lope de Rueda, by
which we are enabled to judge of the literary merit of
these works, divested of the advantage which they must
have derived from the living representation of their
author. Timoneda, who was a bookseller in Valencia,
was the friend and enthusiastic admirer of Lope de
Rueda; but in regard to literary acquirements he
ranked somewhat higher than that actor. He was
indeed a man of genius and talent, as is evident from
his novels, which are little known, and which have yet
to be more particularly noticed in this work. He
printed in small collections, the pastoral dialogues and
plays of Lope de Rueda, making such alterations as
were necessary both in the language and style.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> These
productions equally indicate the experienced master in
the developement of character, and the untutored pupil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
of nature following his own caprice. Lope de Rueda’s
pastoral dialogues possess more dignity, if the term
may be used, than his plays, and they are moreover
imbued with a certain poetic character which harmonizes
admirably with the songs occasionally introduced.
With regard to invention and style, however,
there is but little difference between the dialogues and
the plays, but the pastoral costume of the dramatis
personæ produces a certain heterogeneous effect; for
the half Arcadian, and half Spanish shepherds, are
brought in contact with negresses, barbers, and other
characters of common life and modern stamp. Lope
de Rueda was not inattentive to general character, as
is proved by his delineation of old men, clowns, &amp;c. in
which he was particularly successful. But his principal
aim was to interweave in his dramas, a succession of
intrigues; and, as he seems to have been a stranger to
the art of producing stage effect by striking situations,
he made complication the great object of his plots.
Thus mistakes, arising from personal resemblances,
exchanges of children, and such like common place
subjects of intrigue, form the ground work of his
stories, none of which are remarkable for ingenuity of
invention. There is usually a multitude of characters
in his dramas, and jests and witticisms are freely
introduced, but these in general consist of burlesque
disputes in which some clown is engaged.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p id="NAHARRO_OF_TOLEDO">It would appear that many comedies in Rueda’s
style were at one time acted, though they are now
lost to literature. Cervantes, for instance, praises the
perfection to which that style of comic drama had
been brought by a player, named Naharro of Toledo,
who must not be confounded with Torres Naharro.
Cervantes informs us, that this Naharro augmented the
theatrical wardrobe so considerably, that it could no
longer be contained in a bag, but was packed up in
boxes and chests. He exploded the custom of dressing
the old characters in beards, and removed the orchestra,
which had previously been stationed behind the scenes,
to the front of the stage. He moreover exhibited
imitations of clouds, of thunder and lightning, made
other great improvements in the scenic machinery,
(<i>tramoyas</i>), and even introduced single combats and
battles on the stage. His name certainly deserves to
be preserved from oblivion; and it is unfortunate that
Cervantes has neglected to mention what kind of poetry
or prose was spoken by the actors in these new dramatic
spectacles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>

<p id="JUAN_DE_LA_CUEVA">A Spanish author of learning and merit, named
Juan de la Cueva, who lived about this period, seems
to have been the first to perceive that the Spanish
drama could never succeed, if men of literary acquirements,
endowed with genius for dramatic composition,
continued opposed to the popular party. This meritorious
author was a native of Seville, which at that
time appears to have been the cradle of every kind of
talent. The history of his life is enveloped in obscurity,
and his various writings, in every class of poetry, notwithstanding
the praises which critics have bestowed on
them, are, though not totally sunk into oblivion, very
little known.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> His copious Art of Poetry in tercets, which
was lately, for the first time, published from manuscript,
contains some important information relative to the history
of Spanish poetry. It is, however, merely written
in good versified prose, and pure language, but is in no
respect poetical.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> This Art of Poetry, if so it must
be called, shews, among other things, how numerous
was the party which at that time endeavoured to give
to the Spanish drama the form of the antique. An
author, named Malara, a native of Seville, who was
called the Betisian Menander, in allusion to the Betis
or Gaudalquivir, and six other poets of that city,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
among whom is Gutierre de Cetina, the celebrated
author of several Spanish comedies in the ancient
style, are honourably mentioned by Juan de la Cueva.
But this judicious writer maintained that there were
peculiarities in the ancient drama, which, though excellent
in themselves, would not accord with the spirit of
the moderns. The dramatic laws of the ancients had,
in his opinion, ceased to be obligatory; and he conceived
it to be reasonable that dramatic fictions should be
accommodated to the taste of the age and to the
circumstances in which they are written.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> The Spanish
public had already manifested a strong predilection for
plays in the modern style, and an aversion equally
decided from all the imitations of the dramatic works
of the ancients. It was therefore designedly and with a
persevering industry that the Spaniards had struck out
for themselves a new course in dramatic literature. In
genius and taste they could only have vied with the
Greeks and Romans, without surpassing them; but invention,
grace, ingenious arrangement, and a certain
art of involving and unravelling the plot, which foreigners
could not imitate, were the qualities on which
the glory of the Spanish drama was destined to be
founded.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> Juan de la Cueva proceeds to state, that on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
these principles he had no scruple in contributing to
overthrow the ancient boundary between tragedy and
comedy; and to introduce on the stage, for the sake of
variety, characters clad in the rustic peasant’s garb,
along with others attired in the robes of royalty.
Thus far he trod in the footsteps of Torres Naharro.
And yet he appears to have had no distinct knowledge
of the writings of that author; for he never mentions
them; while, on the other hand, speaking of his own
works, he observes that he had abandoned the old
custom of dividing dramatic pieces into five acts, and
chose in preference the new method, then in vogue, of
arranging them in jornadas.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> Cervantes must of
course have been ignorant of the decided testimony
thus given by Juan de la Cueva, since he imagines that
he was himself the first to introduce the three divisions
of the Spanish drama. The approbation bestowed on
Cueva’s dramatic works, in the new style, seems, however,
to have been but feeble and transitory; and this
explains how the editor of Cervantes’s comedies, in his
account of the early history of the Spanish drama, has
omitted to mention the name of Cueva.</p>

<p>It will, perhaps, be proper to defer entering more
fully into the investigation of the peculiar spirit of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
Spanish national drama, until the writings of Lope de
Vega come under consideration; for during the brilliant
career of that author, the new form of the drama took
complete possession of the Spanish theatre, and the
older pieces, which did not fall in with the popular
taste, were speedily forgotten by the public, as the
notices of Cervantes clearly shew. But it may be
proper here once for all to remind the reader of a truth
now historically demonstrated, namely, that it was by
no means ignorance, or want of intimacy with the
dramatic works of the ancients, which facilitated the
triumph of the modern Spanish drama.</p>

<p id="PROBABLE_RISE_OF_THE_SPIRITUAL_DRAMA_IN_SPAIN">No sufficiently authenticated particulars enable the
literary historian to furnish any thing like positive
information respecting the history of the spiritual
dramas of the Spaniards at the period now under review.
Considered generally their origin is sufficiently
known; for dramas of this kind, intended either for
amusement or instruction, were, in the middle ages,
performed throughout the whole of the south of Europe.
In Spain, pilgrims assiduously devoted themselves
to the dramatic representation of sacred histories,
when they wished to find an edifying and agreeable
relaxation from their severer duties of praying and
journeying from place to place. In these sacred dramas,
the authors often interwove the adventures, whether
serious or comic, in which they had been engaged, or
described what they had seen and learnt in their holy
pilgrimages; and the whole was usually seasoned with
a sufficient quantity of jests in the popular style. To
manifest in as palpable a way as possible the power of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
the sacrament, and the miraculous effects of faith, were
the great objects of the pilgrims; and there seems to be
no doubt that their rude efforts formed the origin of that
class of spiritual plays, which, at a subsequent period,
were performed on the festival of Corpus Christi, and
on other solemn occasions; and which, from their allusion
to the mystery of the sacrament, were styled <i>Autos
Sacramentales</i>. But at what particular period examples
of these spiritual exhibitions were first committed to
writing, and formed a portion of literature, cannot now
be ascertained. They have sometimes been confounded
with the lives of the saints (<i>vidas de santos</i><a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>), which
were originally dramatized in monasteries, and performed
by the pupils of the monks, but which are
in fact quite a distinct class of representations. Up
to the middle of the eighteenth century the practice
of acting these biographical dramas was continued in
monasteries in different parts of Spain, particularly in
Galicia;<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> and perhaps in that province they yet afford
a source of amusement and edification on festival days,
to the pilgrims who visit the shrine of St. Iago de
Compostela.</p>

<p id="ENTREMESES_AND_SAYNETES">The burlesque interludes, called <i>Entremeses</i> and
<i>Saynetes</i>, which were subsequently divided into various
kinds, and were performed between the preludes (<i>loas</i>)
and the play, properly so called, appear also to have
had their origin in the first half of the sixteenth century.
Cervantes could refer to no entremeses of an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
older date, when he contributed to give to this class of
dramatic compositions a literary form and character.</p>

<p>What has been stated sufficiently proves the powerful
control which the public exercised over the stage. The
popular taste demanded an agreeable amusement, created
by the boldest and most varied mixture of the
serious and the comic, of intrigues, sallies of the imagination
and ingenious thoughts, of surprises and animated
situations; but it was not required that either a comic
or a tragic scene should tend to produce any moral
impression on the heart, except indeed in so far as that
object may be attributed to the spiritual pieces. But
how did it happen that a people in whom moral gravity
has ever been a national characteristic, should thus
shew themselves indifferent to the moral effects of their
dramatic entertainments. The history of the formation
of the Spanish character appears to disclose the cause
of this incongruity so clearly, that it might be said,
nature would have contradicted herself, had not such
been the consequence resulting from that cause. When
the treasures of America came to be dispersed through
Spain, luxury and extravagance superseded the old
Spanish simplicity. The age of chivalry was past;
and the ecclesiastical fetters imposed upon opinion and
conscience, afforded so little freedom to the mind, that
it was not possible the public could endure, still less
enjoy, moral reflection on the stage. The Spaniard, as
a catholic Christian, devoutly and implicitly submitted
his understanding to the doctrines and mandates of the
church; but as a man he ardently longed for amusements,
in which he might allow his heart freely to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
participate. Moral reflection then could not be pleasing
in any place where he sought to be gratified by the
unconstrained exercise of his feelings; for every moral
thought tended to revive the recollection of the inquisition.
Meanwhile the progress of luxury and the
love of pleasure stimulated the imagination, and increased
the appetite for sports of wit and fancy, which
were pushed to the most extravagant excess. A people
of an ardent and enthusiastic temperament, which a
genial climate fostered, were always eager to partake
of pleasures which no king or grand inquisitor threatened
to disturb. With a taste thus formed, and with
such claims on dramatic entertainment, the Spaniards
were not to be satisfied with the most ingenious comedies
or tragedies, unless the wildest revels of the imagination
and a succession of joyous and luxuriant forms
agitated and interested the mind, and freed it from all
the fetters of maxims and rules of art. To see a variegated
ideal world, a diversified picture of romantic
existence, was the object for which the Spaniard visited
the theatre, where he could endure no sort of regularity,
not even that which the nature of the subject
seemed most to require.</p>

<p id="SPANISH_TRAGEDIES">This portion of the history of Spanish dramatic
poetry must not be terminated without a particular
notice of two tragedies by Geronymo Bermudez, a
Dominican monk of Galicia, who, at the period when
he wrote them, was probably the inmate of a cloister.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a>
He did not think proper to acknowledge himself the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
author of these dramas, and he published them under
the assumed name of Antonio de Silva.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> Among his
other poetical works, some Spanish writers mention in
terms of respect, a dull encomium on the Duke of Alba,
of whom this ecclesiastic was an enthusiastic admirer.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a>
He lived until the year 1589. His two tragedies are
imitations of the ancient drama, but they must not be
confounded with the essays of the same kind, which
have already been mentioned. Bermudez conceived
the happy idea of selecting a subject from the history
of Spain and Portugal, and dramatizing it according to
the rules of the Greek tragedy, without destroying the
modern character of his materials. The well known
story of the unfortunate Ines de Castro, seemed particularly
suited to the object he had in view. Being a
Galician, he had, through his native language, a national
relationship to Portugal, and he consequently took more
personal interest in the tragical fate of his heroine, than
was felt by Spaniards in general. He did not commence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
his task without apprehension of its success;
for, as a Spaniard, he wished to write in Castilian, and
he was, therefore, in some measure, under the necessity
of studying a foreign language. This difficulty he
mentions in his preface. But with all its faults, his
attempt proved so fortunate, that his two tragedies
may justly be styled the first in their kind. Though
they are intimately connected, yet each forms in itself a
complete tragic drama. Their titles are whimsical and
affected: the first is denominated, <i>Nise Lastimosa</i>, (the
Lamentable Nise); and the second, <i>Nise Laureada</i>,
(Nise Crowned with Glory).<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> The characters preserve
their historical names. The first of these tragedies
sufficiently proves what may be effected by a
poet, even of moderate talent, when thoroughly penetrated
with a poetic subject, and at the same time
possessing the power of expression. The Nise Lastimosa,
it is true, is far from approaching the ideal of
tragic perfection; but some of the scenes fulfil all that
the theory of the dramatic art can require; and energy
and dignity of expression are not wanting even in those
passages where the action is tedious and the incidents
ill-connected. The plot is simple, and towards the conclusion
its interest declines. But Bermudez has introduced,
with alternate instances of remarkable dexterity
and clumsiness, a chorus composed of Coimbran women,
which is sometimes interwoven with the action of the
drama, and sometimes quite independent of it. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
unities of time and place the author has totally disregarded.
The first act opens with a soliloquy by the
Prince Don Pedro, which is beautiful, though somewhat
too long. In it the prince deplores his separation
from his beloved wife.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> This soliloquy is succeeded
by a long conversation between the prince and his
secretary, in which the latter, with all due courtesy,
hints that the attachment of the prince for a lady, not
of royal birth, is incompatible with the welfare of the
state.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> The scene then changes, and the chorus of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
Coimbran women is very absurdly introduced to moralize
on love. Thus closes the first act. In the second,
the scene changes to the court, and exhibits the king
amidst his assembled council; the advice of the ministers
prevails over the good disposition of the monarch,
and he consents to the death of Ines de Castro.
A soliloquy by the king follows, in which he offers up
his prayers. The scene again changes, and the fair
Coimbrans once more appear to moralize on human
happiness. In the third act, however, a new spirit is
infused into the piece, and the chorus partakes in the
action. Ines de Castro appears. The women of the
chorus form her attendants, and offer her consolation
and advice. Ines is informed of the reports that are
circulated respecting her fate;<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> but throughout this act,
the progress of the story is nearly suspended. The fourth
act may, however, be accounted almost a masterpiece.
Ines attended by her children and the chorus, appears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
before the king to receive her sentence. Nothing can
be more impressive than the dignity with which she
demands justice, or more affecting than the tenderness
towards her children, which continually breaks
forth in her discourse; at length she pictures to herself
in vivid colours, the sorrows that await her husband,
till exhausted by the vehemence of her feelings,
and gradually losing the use of her faculties, she
begins for the first time to think of her own situation,
anticipates the horrors of death, and swoons,
exclaiming <i>Jesus Maria!</i> This scene exhibits a picture
so replete with real pathos, that it may be truly
said, modern tragic art has seldom attained so high
a point of perfection.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> The fifth act is merely a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
tedious supplement. The prince is made acquainted
with the death of his wife, and he vents his sorrow in
long lamentations.</p>

<p>The tragedy of <i>Nise Laureada</i> is far inferior to
that just described. The story is below criticism; and
towards the end becomes revolting to feelings, which
are not blunted by inquisitorial horrors, or sunk to the
level of brutality. The Prince Don Pedro who has
now ascended the throne, orders the remains of his
judicially murdered wife to be taken from the tomb;
he then, with great solemnity, invests the corpse with
the dignity of queen, and the ceremony of the coronation
is succeeded by a marriage. Two of the counsellors,
whose perverted and inhuman patriotism had
urged them to sacrifice the unhappy Ines, receive sentence
of death and are executed. This is the whole
plot, if so it may be called; and among the acting and
speaking characters the executioners play a prominent
part. The first act contains many beautiful passages;
but when the last judicial ceremonies commence, horror
and disgust fill the mind of the reader. The hearts of
both culprits are extracted from their bodies, the one
through the breast, and the other through the back.
The most brutal exclamations accompany the execution
of the royal sentence, and the chorus utters shouts of
joy, while the executioner discharges his barbarous task.
That these horrors might be regarded as pathetic incidents
by the Spaniards of that age, accustomed as they
were from early childhood to stifle every sentiment of
humanity, and to allow fanatical exultation to overcome
the natural emotions of the heart, whenever a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
brutal sentence was pronounced by ecclesiastical, or
royal authority, is unfortunately but too probable. Had
it not been for this perversion of feeling, a people,
otherwise so noble-minded, could not have attended
the cruel festivals of their church, and witnessed the
burning of Jews and heretics with as much pleasure
as the exhibition of a bull fight.</p>

<p>In order to form a just estimate of the talent of
Bermudez, it must be recollected that he was the first
who conceived the idea of giving a poetic colouring to
the history of Ines de Castro. Camoens had not, at
that time, written his Lusiad, in which the same story
forms the subject of a celebrated episode. It may also
be observed, that the labour which Bermudez bestowed
on his versification, and particularly on the varied metres
of the choruses of his dramas, ought to have
served as an example to his successors in tragic composition.</p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_OF_SPANISH_PROSE_DURING_THE_FIRST_HALF">HISTORY OF SPANISH PROSE DURING THE FIRST
HALF AND TEN SUCCEEDING YEARS OF THE
SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

<p>Among the works of the poets which come within
the period allotted to the first section of this book, it
has already been necessary to notice some writings in
prose. The connexion then subsisting between Spanish
poetry and prose, has thus been rendered more apparent,
and the different works of the same author
have been kept together in examining them. But the
poetic talent of some authors of that age, for example,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Perez de Oliva, will not bear a comparison with their
merits as prose writers; and many others who have obtained
reputation for prose composition, must be totally
excluded from the rank of poets. In general the good
sense of the Spanish writers has constantly impelled
them to mark a distinct boundary between poetry and
prose; and this separation was never more rigorously
maintained than during the first half of the sixteenth
century, when the torrent of romances of chivalry
which then inundated Spain, threatened the common
annihilation of genuine poetry and eloquent prose. As
very little has hitherto been done in this department
of literature, advantage cannot fail to be derived
from the labour which may be employed in endeavouring
to obtain something like an accurate introduction
to the knowledge of several good Spanish prose
writers, whose names have hitherto scarcely appeared
in the history of modern literature.</p>

<p id="PROSE_ROMANCES_OF_CHIVALRY">Every one who has read Don Quixote must be
aware of the enthusiasm with which romances of chivalry
were admired by the Spaniards, at the end of the
sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century.
In the reign of Charles V. this passion became
epidemic; for then the art of printing gave general
circulation to the old romances, and new imitations
were not wanting. But the particular account of this
portion of Spanish literature, does not belong to the
present subject, and ought to form the conclusion of
the history of the romantic literature of the middle
ages. Besides, the influence of the chivalrous romances
of the sixteenth century, operated on the public only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
in a peculiar sense of the term, for every poet and
prose writer, of cultivated talent, laboured to oppose
the contagion. There were, however, many literary
partizans, who did not scruple to flatter the public taste
by the grossest absurdities. A writer, named Geronymo
de Sanpedro, with the most devout piety, selected stories
from the bible, and clothed them, as he expresses himself,
in the allegoric costume of romance. He entitled his fantastical
work, “The Book of Celestial Chivalry from
the Foot of the Fragrant Rose-bush.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a>” God the
Father is introduced in this edifying production as
emperor, and Christ as the knight of the Lion, (<i>Caballero
del Leon</i>). In the meantime an opponent of the
zealots of chivalry, named Doctor Alexio de Venegas,
anathematized all romances, which he styled, “Devil’s
Sermon Books,” (<i>Sermonarios de Satanas</i>).<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> In this
manner parties contended one with another in Spain,
until at length the romantic literature disappeared like
a stream lost amidst sand.</p>

<p id="LAZARILLO_DE_TORMES">At this period there appears to have existed no
novels or romances in the modern style, except the
<i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i> of Diego de Mendoza. The well
known imitations of this first romance of knavery (<i>del
gusto picaresco</i>) did not come into circulation before
the end of the sixteenth century. Little stories in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
style of the Italian novels were, it is true, written
at an earlier period; but their author, the bookseller
Timoneda, the same individual who collected the comedies
and pastoral dramas of Lope de Rueda, did not
venture to prefix to them the title of <i>Novelas</i>. He
was aware that he could better recommend his works
to the Spanish public, by giving them the old denomination
of <i>Patrañas</i> (Tales).<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> Timoneda evidently imitated
the Italian novelists, though he by no means
equalled them. Still, however, these antiquated tales
may be perused with pleasure, particularly by those who
have a taste for complicated intrigue. The author,
it would appear, endeavoured to surpass the Italian
writers in romantic adventures and unexpected incidents;
at least in his preface he expressly promises this
kind of entertainment to his readers.</p>

<p id="TALES_OF_JUAN_TIMONEDA">But it was not merely with romances and novels
that genuine prose literature had to contend in Spain.
Several men of distinguished talent, however far they
carried their notions of patriotism in other respects,
were of opinion that the Spanish language was incapable
of expressing grave and noble ideas in prose.
Some would write only in Latin, and others only in
Italian. Alphonso de Ulloa, who was an assiduous
historical and political author, wrote chiefly in Italian.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a>
He was, it is true, born in Italy; but he was of a Spanish
family, and the Spanish language was perfectly
familiar to him. The want of confidence thus shewn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
by Spanish writers in the force and precision of their
own language seems inexplicable, when it is recollected
at how early a period Spanish prose began to be cultivated.
Their intercourse with the Italians had, however,
made the Spaniards perceive a want of elegance both
in their colloquial phraseology and literary style; but
that grace which their poets soon began to imitate from
the Italians, is but feebly indicated in the works of the
early Spanish prose writers, whatever other rhetorical
merits they might possess, and a frank simplicity of
expression appears still to have constituted the main
character of Spanish prose. Besides, the Italian prose,
which with the exception of the writings of Machiavell
and Guicciardini is distinguished by a playful
and too often superficial elegance, could not be very
congenial to the Spanish taste, which required a grave
and energetic style. To imitate the ancient classics
was the only means whereby the prose literature of
Spain could have been cultivated in a manner answerable
to the demands of enlightened men in the sixteenth
century. Unfortunately the ecclesiastical and political
despotism of this period left no free scope for the exercise
of the mental powers of those Spaniards who were
desirous of constructing a national prose style on the
ancient models. Neither the didactic nor the historical
styles could be freely developed; and for the formation
of the oratorical style, circumstances were, if possible,
still more unfavourable. Impeded by such obstacles,
and permitted only to copy in the strictest sense the
rhetorical forms of the ancients, without their energy
and solidity of thought, and their force of expression,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
the Spanish prose writers certainly could not be expected
to produce works worthy to be ranked on a
level with the classic examples they would have wished
to emulate; but their efforts to open the career of
genuine eloquence to their national literature, deserves,
notwithstanding, to be honourably recorded.</p>

<p id="DIDACTIC_PROSE">1. <span class="smcap">Didactic Prose</span> is, in the Spanish language,
indebted for its first formation to Fernan Perez de Oliva
of Cordova. At the commencement of the sixteenth
century this learned man travelled through Italy and
France, and during three years which he spent in Paris
delivered public lectures on philosophy and ancient literature.
On his return to Spain he settled at Salamanca,
where he became professor (<i>cathedratico</i>) of theology,
and delivered lectures on the Aristotelian philosophy.
He died in 1533, before he had completed his thirty-sixth
year.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> His philosophic and theological studies,
and his intimacy with Grecian and Roman literature,
did not withhold him from the cultivation of his native
language; and he even endeavoured, by his translations
which have already been mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> to naturalize the
Greek tragedy in Spain. He also wrote several poems,
which in honour of his memory, are still preserved.
But Perez de Oliva was no poet; and to judge from
his translations he appears to have had scarcely any
true poetic feeling, though he possessed a correct and
delicate taste for the rhetorical beauty of prose. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
most celebrated work is his Dialogue on the Dignity of
Man (<i>Dialogo de la Dignidad del Hombre</i>) in the
manner of Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> It would be vain to seek in this
didactic dialogue for ideas which present the merit of
novelty in the present age; and it can by no means be
regarded as a model of dialogue style any more than
the similar works of Cicero. But it was the first
specimen in Spanish literature, of clear and connected
discussion, maintained in correct dignified and elegant
language. The colloquial form serves to connect, though
somewhat loosely, the two portions into which the work
is divided. Two philosophic friends meet, and their
conversation turns on solitude: they endeavour to
explain the causes which induce man to seek
retirement, and which render him dissatisfied with the
society of his fellow creatures. One of the friends
inveighs against human society, while the other extols
its advantages. In the mean while they are joined by
a third philosopher who becomes the arbiter. Before
this judge each disputant propounds his opinions in an
uninterrupted discourse. Thus the oratorical style is
now mingled with the didactic, which had before
superseded the colloquial style. This blending of the
didactic and oratorical styles, must doubtless be a
subject of critical censure to many readers; but with
the exception of the oratorical passages, the dialogue
of Perez de Oliva is written, in a natural and easy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
manner.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> The ideas are for the most part clearly and
accurately developed,<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> and the oratorical language,
particularly where it is appropriately introduced, is
powerful and picturesque.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p id="PEREZ_DE_OLIVA">Perez de Oliva had a successful pupil in his nephew
<span id="AMBROSIO_DE_MORALES">Ambrosio de Morales</span>, who was also a native of Cordova.
This learned writer was born in the year
1513; after having finished his academic studies at the
university of Alcala de Henares, he delivered public
lectures on philosophy and ancient literature, by which
he soon acquired an honourable reputation. Charles V.
appointed him classical tutor to his natural son Don
John of Austria, who afterwards became so celebrated.
On the death of Charles V. Ambrosio de Morales was
installed by King Philip II. in the vacant post of
historiographer or chronicler (<i>coronista</i>) of Castile.
From the period when he entered upon this office he
appears to have devoted himself exclusively to historical
studies. He died at an advanced age. His
didactic works consist of treatises (<i>discursos</i>) on various
subjects of practical philosophy and literature. In one
of these treatises, he expressly and urgently recommends
the rhetorical cultivation of the Spanish language, which
the writers of that age so unjustly disowned and neglected
to the great prejudice of literature and even
of philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> The other dissertations of this meritorious
writer, which are not so much known, relate to
the importance of rhetorical studies; the distinction
between Plato’s and Aristotle’s methods of instruction;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
the duty of man to exert himself to the utmost when
he wishes for the assistance of the Almighty; the
difference between a great and a good understanding;
the value of wealth, independent of personal merit in
the possessor; and such like objects of general utility.
He only occasionally casts a side glance on the region
of speculative philosophy, so that among Germans he
might with propriety be called the Spanish Garve.
Like that author his views were clear rather than
profound; and like him also his object was to write
pure didactic prose. His style, though not energetic
nor impressive, is natural, clear, and precise, and not unfrequently
adorned with pleasing images.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> The pedantic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
allusions to the scriptures and to classical literature
must be attributed to the age and country to which
Morales belonged.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p id="PEDRO_DE_VALLES">Pedro de Valles, another native of Cordova, followed
the example of Perez de Oliva, in cultivating prose;
but he inclined to the pomp and antitheses of Seneca,
which he was perhaps induced to imitate from respect
for his countryman; for the learned of Cordova have
always prided themselves in being natives of a city
which had produced an ancient author of so much
celebrity. Morales, in his collection of his own and
his uncle’s works, has inserted a treatise by Valles on
the Fear of Death.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>

<p id="FRANCISCO_CERVANTES_DE_SALAZAR">Francisco Cervantes de Salazar, who lived about
the same period, likewise followed the tract which had
been marked out by Perez de Oliva. Respecting the
life of this writer but few particulars are known; and
the resemblance of his name to that of the celebrated
Cervantes Saavedra, does not appear to be a sufficient
reason for concluding that he was related to that distinguished
author. Cervantes de Salazar wrote a continuation
of Oliva’s Dialogue on the Dignity of Man;
for he regarded it as unfinished, because Oliva allows
the friend and the enemy of human nature to deliver
their opinions, while the third party, who is appointed
the philosophic arbiter, draws no inference from the
arguments he hears. Through the medium of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
third character, Salazar circumstantially recapitulates
the whole theme, and arrives at a decided conclusion.
Salazar is a more contemplative writer than Oliva, who,
in other respects appears to have been his model. He
translated from the Greek the Tabla of Cebes, and from
the Latin the <i>Introductio ad sapientiam</i> of Luis Vives,
one of the learned Spaniards who did not choose to
write in their native tongue. He published his continuations
and translations along with the original
works.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p>Among the various works which Cervantes de
Salazar published and elucidated, is an allegorical
romance, entitled “<i>Labricio</i>, or the fable (<i>Apologo</i>) of
Idleness and Industry.” This romance may be placed
if not among, at least beside didactic works, for the
allegorical form serves merely to clothe the ideas,
which are very methodically developed. The author,
Luis Mexia, or Messia, was a learned theologian and
jurist. His object was to draw an interesting and animated
picture of the dangers of idleness, the pleasures
of occupation, and the value of well directed industry.
Notwithstanding the faults inseparable from the class
of writing to which this work belongs, it presents the
charm of an animated picture conveyed in language,
which, though occasionally declamatory, is, upon the
whole, pure and elegant.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

<p id="HISTORICAL_PROSE">2. <span class="smcap">Historical Prose</span> was, during this period, cultivated
by no author in so high a degree as by Diego
de Mendoza, whose history of the wars of Granada,
has already been particularly mentioned; all the other
Spanish historians were inferior to Mendoza in every
thing that constitutes the historical art. But they had
begun to study that art, in which they would no doubt
have distinguished themselves, had they not on the one
hand been intimidated by the despotism of the government,
and on the other, influenced by a spirit of contradiction,
which induced them to banish from genuine
history every trace of imaginative colouring, lest they
should be confounded with the romance writers of the
age.</p>

<p>The historical institution, established by Alphonso
the Wise, still subsisted; for the Spanish government
was afraid to incur the shame of allowing it to perish.
National historiographers or chroniclers were accordingly
appointed, and paid in the same manner as formerly;
but after the accession of Charles V. those chroniclers
could not venture to write with freedom, even in favour
of the court party. Charles V. thought it prudent to
obliterate as far as possible the recollection of the
powerful opposition he had experienced on his succession
to the Spanish crown. His chronicler, Florian de
Ocampo, was a man of talent and information; and
these qualifications soon enabled him to perceive the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
necessity of protracting as much as possible the duty
assigned to the old Spanish chroniclers of writing the
history of their own age. Fortunately for him there
existed at that period no ancient history of Spain; and
this was a subject on which he could enter, without
fear or constraint, while, at the same time, it afforded
scope for a singular display of erudition. Ocampo
accordingly wrote his five books of a General Chronicle
of Spain. By the selection of this deceiving title,
Ocampo appeared to be fulfilling the duties of his office;
but the five books of his General Chronicle contain
nothing more than the history of ancient Hispania,
from the deluge to the second punic war.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> The work
is not badly written, though it presents nothing particularly
attractive either in the style or in the handling
of the subject. Ocampo selected his materials chiefly
from the ancient authors, with whom he must have
been intimately acquainted; but as far as relates to
historical art he avoided imitating his classical models,
because, as he says, he was afraid to substitute for
truth “the rhetorical flourishes and vanities, which
appear in other books of the present time.”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> Like
some German historians, he seems to have prided
himself in his dulness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<p>Those truths which dared not be publicly told in
the reign of Charles V. still remained secrets under the
government of Philip II. But even the latter monarch
did not suffer the office of national chronicler to be discontinued;
and he nominated a particular historiographer
for the provinces of Castile, and another for those of
Arragon. The learned Ambrosio de Morales, who took
so lively an interest in the advancement of the rhetorical
art, was, as has already been mentioned, appointed
chronicler for the Castilian provinces. But with all his
talent and information, Morales was not the man precisely
calculated to occupy this situation, had he wished
strictly to discharge its duties. He had little taste for
politics, and modern history was not the branch of literature
in the cultivation of which he was likely to find
the employment best suited to his talents. He therefore
could do nothing which better accorded with his own inclination,
and the circumstances in which he was placed,
than to follow the footsteps of Ocampo, and to continue
the ancient history of Spain from the second punic
war to the establishment of christianity.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> He vied
with his predecessor in research and erudition; while,
at the same time, he devoted far more attention to composition
and style. In his preface, he states that he
availed himself of this opportunity of proving the
dignity and majesty of the Spanish language; and in
that respect he rose far superior to the usual chronicle
style. In point of elegance, however, he did not equal
cardinal Bembo, while he really had no more idea than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
that author, of the soul of the historical art, of which
elegance is merely an accessary.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> Towards the close
of his work, when he came to the christian ages, his zeal
induced him to insert the lives of the saints of Spanish
origin; and certainly no writer before his time ever
gave to that description of biography so much elegance
and historical dignity. Indeed the simplicity to which
Morales was always faithful, is a remarkable feature in
the works of an author who was so ambitious of distinguishing
himself by his style.</p>

<p>There appeared, however, at this time, another
author, who might have become, if not the Livy, at
least the Machiavell of Spain, had he been placed in
more favourable circumstances, and been disposed to
devote himself to the rhetorical cultivation of his talent
for historical composition. He was a native of Arragon,
and his name was Geronymo Zurita, Surita or Curita,
for it is written in these different ways. Philip II.
appointed him historiographer of the Arragonian provinces,
an office which he was well qualified to fill.
Like all educated Arragonese, he wrote Castilian with
as much facility as his mother tongue. As a politician,
however, he entertained views respecting the practical
application of history, which though clear and well
founded, were not likely to be very acceptable to a
despotic sovereign. Zurita undertook, not merely the
tedious task of exploring the old chronicles and records,
to which he had access, in order to produce a complete
history of the kingdom of Arragon, from the Moorish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
invasion to the reign of Charles V. he was moreover
desirous that his historical labour should exhibit a
faithful view of the rise and formation of the national
constitution of Arragon. The modern historian, who
may wish to investigate this particular point, ought to
resort to the pages of Zurita, for it will be difficult for
him to find a more instructive author. Zurita gave to
his historical work the title of Annals,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> which he conceived
to be more appropriate than that of chronicle.
But he felt the difficulty of the task he had undertaken,
when he attempted to develope the republican principles
of the Arragonian provinces, and at the same
time to do homage to the caprice of an absolute
monarch. He must necessarily have written this part of
his work in the total absence of inspiration, for the only
practical conclusion he draws from his researches is the
trite maxim, “that subjects ought to be content if peace
and tranquillity prevail in the country in which they
live;”<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> and it must be confessed that for peace and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
tranquillity, in a certain sense, Philip II. with the help
of the Duke of Alba and the inquisition, had sufficiently
provided. But in order to judge how Zurita would
have written, had he been permitted to write freely,
the grounds of the decision must be collected only from
detached passages of his work. His execution indeed
is not so inviting as to excite a strong desire for the
perusal of the whole. He seems during his laborious
researches unconsciously to have imbibed the formal
style of the chroniclers, their constantly recurring <i>and</i>
not excepted; while he did not allow himself time to
separate the important from the unimportant, and by a
judicious distribution of his materials to compose a
pleasing historical picture. In a literary contest, which
arose respecting the merits and defects of these Annals
of Arragon, their value, in a rhetorical point of view,
was never taken into consideration.</p>

<p id="ORATORICAL_PROSE">3. <span class="smcap">Oratorical Prose.</span>&mdash;To other classes of
prose writing, the Spaniards at this time devoted but
little attention; but two printed discourses by Perez de
Oliva well deserve to be more generally known. The
one was delivered at the request of a society of patriotic
citizens of Cordova, and it relates to the advantages to
be derived from the navigation of the Guadalquivir.
In the first part of this discourse, the learned orator
certainly wanders far from his subject, for he speaks of
the Greeks and Romans, and even of the Trojan war;
but the second part contains a view of the business in
hand, which is vigorously unfolded, full of sound sense,
and divested of all affectation and pedantry. The
second discourse promises but little, for it is merely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
described as an academic occasional and defensive
address; but it contains a very good explanation of the
literary duties of a professor of moral philosophy, together
with some particulars respecting the literary life
of the author, which are related in an excellent oratorical
style.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p id="EPISTOLARY_PROSE">4. Of the <span class="smcap">Epistolary Prose</span> of this age but
few printed specimens exist; and it may be presumed
that the Spaniards could not experience much pleasure
in written correspondence, after their epistolary style
had, like that of their social conversation, become
subject to the restraint of the ceremonial forms with
which the Italians and the Germans were about the
same time infected. With whatever ease <i>vuessa merced</i>
(your grace or your worship) especially when contracted
in conversation into <i>usté</i>, might glide, as a mere form
of courtesy through Spanish lips, its frequent occurrence
could not fail to have a very embarrassing effect in the
periods of familiar letters. This formula which every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
man of education employed in addressing his equals,
exhibits a striking contrast to the higher ceremonial
style, which the king himself observed in corresponding
with his relatives. Among the Spanish epistolary
documents of the sixteenth century, there has been
preserved a letter from Philip II. to his natural brother,
Don John of Austria. This letter appears to be a
kind of supplement, written by the king himself, to
the commission by which Don John was appointed high
admiral of the Spanish fleets (<i>capitan general de la
mar</i>). The king with old Spanish cordiality calls Don
John, “brother,” (<i>hermano</i>), without any other title;
and when he addresses him in the course of the letter, he
uses the pronoun <i>you</i>, after the old fashion. In reminding
his natural brother of his duties, he recommends
to him integrity, as next in importance to religion.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></p>

<p>There is also preserved a letter from the Duke of
Alba, of odious celebrity, to Don John of Austria. It
contains military instructions expressed with precision
and dignified simplicity; but the style is encumbered by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
the repetition of titles. Both letters are contained in a
collection published by the diligent Gregorio Mayans
y Siscar.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<h3 id="SPANISH_CRITICISM_DURING_THE_PERIOD_OF_THIS_SECTION">SPANISH CRITICISM DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS
SECTION.</h3>

<p>It would scarcely be worth while to say any thing
relative to Spanish criticism during the period this section
embraces, were it not that among the books of
instruction on poetry and rhetoric which then appeared,
there was one, which besides being extraordinary for
the age in which it was produced, may be regarded as
the first of its kind in modern literature. It is entitled,
the Philosophy of the Ancient Style of Poetry, which
in Spanish is somewhat fantastically expressed, <i>Philosophia
Antigua Poetica</i>. This work is the production
of Alonzo Lopez Pinciano, physician to Charles V. who
as has been mentioned, was likewise the author of an
unsuccessful heroic poem.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> Though Pinciano possessed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
few qualifications for a poet, he had nevertheless conceived
the idea of writing an Art of Poetry, which should
be something more than a mere introduction to versification
and instructions relative to correct and figurative
expression. Speculations on the elements of poetry constituted
his chief occupation, when relieved from the
duties of his profession. He had so carefully studied
Aristotle’s Art of Poetry, and so attentively compared it
with the other writings of the same author, that of all
the admirers of that work, he was probably the first
who discovered its imperfection. He says&mdash;“what is
called Aristotle’s Art of Poetry cannot, if rightly understood,
be regarded in any other light than as a fragment;
for Aristotle, in various passages of his other works,
refers to a second part of this Art of Poetry, which is lost.”
Pinciano’s conjectures respecting the contents of the lost
part, and its connection with the fragment now existing,
have, it is true, been contradicted by more modern
critics; but this physician was nevertheless the first to observe
that imperfection which had escaped the notice of
all previous philologists and commentators on Aristotle.
He remarks, that the philologists and commentators
have written very learned works; which, however, are
as imperfect as the text which they elucidate. With
the view of restoring poetry to its ancient dignity, and
establishing and developing its true spirit, Lopez
Pinciano commences with an Analysis of the Wants
of Human Nature. He treats minutely of the senses,
of the affections, the faculties of the soul, wisdom, and
the pleasures peculiar to cultivated minds, but always
with reference to the works of Aristotle, whom, like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
other writers of that age, he merely designates by the
title of the <i>philosopher</i>. Like Aristotle, he makes
imitation the essence of poetry; but with a particular
and more precise definition of what in his opinion
constitutes poetic imitation. He then enters upon
reflections concerning poetic language, and gives a
detailed theory of the several kinds of poetry. The
present, however, is not the proper place to present an
explanation of this theory. Whenever Lopez Pinciano
abandons Aristotle, his notions respecting the different
poetic styles are as confused as those of his contemporaries;
and only a few of his notions and distinctions
can be deemed of importance at the present day.
But his name is deserving of honourable remembrance,
for he was the first writer of modern times who endeavoured
to establish a philosophic art of poetry; and
with all his veneration for Aristotle, he was the first
scholar who ventured to think for himself, and to go
somewhat further than his master. He also evinced a
laudable perseverance in the execution of his task.
Pinciano’s learned and ingenious work was not quite so
useful as it might have been, owing in a great measure
to its artificial and formal manner of composition,
which, however, the author considered singularly easy
and natural. This Art of Poetry is written in the form
of letters, (which was in itself a novelty at that age),
and in these letters, conversations are occasionally introduced.
The friend who answers, invariably gives an
abstract of the letter he has last received, as a proof
that he understands its contents and its object. Lopez
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
Pinciano, however, cannot be regarded as a model in
epistolary and conversational prose any more than in
poetry.</p>

<p>The authors of the other arts of poetry which
appeared about this time in the Spanish language,
merely confined themselves to the explanation of metrical
forms and the establishment of subordinate
principles. Among these authors were Sanchez de
Viena, Geronymo de Mondragon, and Juan Diaz.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> An
Art of Poetry of the same description in verse, by Juan
de la Cueva, has already been mentioned. From a philosophic
treatise of this kind, Spanish poetry could derive
no advantage, unless its origin had been totally
different from what it really was. Theories, even the
most popular, can contribute only in a very slight degree
to the formation of the poetic genius, either of nations
or individuals.</p>

<p>Several works on the art of rhetoric, in which the
principles of Aristotle were followed, appeared about
this time in Spain; but they produced nothing valuable
with respect to theory, and exercised no remarkable
influence on the improvement of Spanish prose.

<span class="hang medium"><i>History of Spanish Poetry and Eloquence, from the
Age of Cervantes and Lope de Vega to the
Middle of the Seventeenth Century.</i></span></h2>

<p>Spanish literature had now assumed a new character.
Classical poets wrote in the Castilian language;
and elegant prose was cultivated with equal rapidity
and success on the model of the ancients. No great
advantage could henceforth be derived from the imitation
of the Italian poets, for the genius of the Spanish
nation had well nigh decided how far and under what
limitations the Italian poetry could be naturalized in
Spain. But laurels were yet to be gathered on the
new Parnassus; and the conflict between the ancient
and modern styles, had, through the disputes of the
different parties, who sought to rule the Spanish drama,
at length arrived at a crisis. Under these circumstances,
Cervantes and Lope de Vega entered upon the career
which their predecessors had opened for them.</p>

<h3 id="CERVANTES">CERVANTES.</h3>

<p>The life of this extraordinary man, whom, for the
space of two centuries, civilized Europe has admired
above every other Spanish writer, has been so frequently
related, that a brief abstract of his biography, derived
from the most authentic sources, will be sufficient for
the purpose of this history.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p>It is a singular fact, that the contemporaries of this
celebrated man, whom every town, not merely in
Spain, but throughout the world, would be proud to
have produced, should have neglected to record his
native place. After long investigations and warm disputes,
which call to mind the contests of the seven
Greek towns, for the honour of having given birth to
Homer, it is at length agreed that the greatest share
of probability belongs to the conjecture, according to
which Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra was born at Alcalà
de Henàres in the year 1547. His parents, who were
not rich, were merely enabled to give him a moderate,
but at the same time a literary education. They sent
him to the schools of Madrid, where he acquired some
knowledge of classical learning. At Madrid he had
an opportunity of witnessing the dramas which the ingenious
Lope de Rueda represented on his wretched
stage. Juan Lopez, the tutor of Cervantes, was an
indefatigable writer of poetry, particularly of romances,
and he sought every means of cherishing his pupils’
taste for poetic composition. Some verses by Cervantes
were introduced in a description of the funeral of a
Spanish princess, which Lopez published in 1569.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span></p>

<p>But young Cervantes, who had now attained his
twenty-second year, seems to have had no certain means
of gaining a subsistence. He wrote numerous romances
and sonnets; and it was probably about this period that
he composed a pastoral romance, entitled <i>Filena</i>, which,
if we may give credit to his own testimony, was very
generally read.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> It appears that he thought he could
better his condition by travelling; and he resolved to
proceed to Italy. Here commences the period of his
adventures. In Rome, cardinal Acquaviva for a short
time became his patron and protector. But impelled
either by necessity or choice, he entered into the military
profession. He enlisted under the banners of his
sovereign, to serve in the wars against the Turks and
African corsairs, who at that time disturbed the tranquillity
of Spain and Italy. During the war he proved
himself to be wholly devoted to his new profession; but
being engaged in the great battle of Lepanto, in 1572,
he received a wound which deprived him of his left
hand together with a part of the arm. This honourable
mutilation, to which he proudly alludes in his latter
writings, obliged him to return to Spain. The ship,
however, in which he had embarked, was captured by
an Algerine corsair, and Cervantes was conveyed to
Algiers and sold for a slave. His captivity which lasted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
for nearly eight years, must have been of the most romantic
description, if the fact be, as has frequently been
conjectured, that Cervantes described his own adventures
in the novel of the Captive.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> He was at length ransomed,
and in the year 1581 he returned to his native country.</p>

<p>The third period of the life of Cervantes was exclusively
devoted to literature. He had now attained his
thirty-second year, and with a matured understanding,
joined to considerable practical knowledge of the world,
and an ardent passion for literature, he resolved to
withdraw from the busy scene of life. In his retirement
he wrote his second pastoral romance, entitled <i>Galatea</i>,
which has so eclipsed Filena, that the latter is quite
neglected and forgotten. He shortly afterwards married,
and in all probability lived for some time on his wife’s
dowry. At length he began to write for the stage; but
the dramas which he composed at this period of his life,
though about thirty in number, are nearly all lost.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a>&mdash;About
this time arose the rivalry between Cervantes
and Lope de Vega, whose dramas were so much
admired that they bore away the palm of public favour.
Mortified, as it would appear, by the ill success of his
dramatic efforts, Cervantes laid aside his pen for a considerable
period. It is conjectured, that in the meanwhile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
he obtained a post in Seville, the emoluments of
which enabled him to subsist. He did not again appear
in the literary world until the death of Philip II. in the
year 1598.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be doubted, though no Spanish writer
has made the conjecture, that the death of Philip II.
had a favourable influence on the genius of Cervantes.
After the accession of the indolent Philip III. every
man in Spain felt that he might then have more
freedom than he dared to take during the gloomy
intolerance of the preceding reign. The Spaniards
now ventured to sport with the chains which they had
not the power to break, and delicate satire was soon
freely employed. Cervantes quickly found a subject
for ridicule, in an outrageous contest which arose in
Seville between the spiritual and municipal authorities,
concerning the funeral obsequies of the deceased
monarch. There is reason to believe that he composed,
about the same period, some of the Instructive
Novels (<i>Novelas Exemplares</i>), which he subsequently
published. What accident gave rise to the idea of his
Don Quixote is unknown; for his having, while travelling
through the province of la Mancha, become engaged
in disputes with some of the inhabitants, and his being
on that account for a short time imprisoned, can at
most be only supposed to have suggested the idea of
making that province the scene of the first part of his
romance. Some fortunate circumstance, which cannot
now be traced, seems to have impressed Cervantes,
who was then in his fiftieth year, with the consciousness
of the true bent of his genius. The commencement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
of Don Quixote was first published at Madrid, in
1606; but the enthusiastic reception which this original
romance experienced from the Spanish public, produced
very little change in the author’s fortune; for the folly
which felt itself disturbed in its security united with
envy in seeking to discover the most offensive allusions
in the work. Cervantes accordingly continued poor, and
had now to contend with exasperated enemies, who
imagined they had completely defeated him, when an
unknown writer of their own party, under the name
of Avellaneda, published a continuation of Don Quixote,
full of invective against the original author. Precisely
at the period when this continuation appeared, Cervantes
published the sequel of his Instructive Novels,
which he dedicated to the Count of Lemos. In that
nobleman he found a protector who never withdrew
his favour, and who, as it appears, afforded him support
in various ways. Pecuniary necessity seems, however,
to have urged him, as a last resource, to write for the
stage.</p>

<p>The latest works of Cervantes, were the genuine
continuation and completion of Don Quixote, the
Journey to Parnassus, which was first published in
1614, and finally the romance of Persiles and Sigismunda,
for which, a few days previous to his death, he
wrote a dedication to the Count of Lemos. From various
passages in the prefaces and introductions to these
last works, it is obvious how highly Cervantes prized
that celebrity which, after many abortive efforts, he had
at length obtained in his old age. But even where
his vanity is not disguised, it is easy, from the candid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
tone in which he speaks of himself, to recognize the
man of firm and upright spirit, the declared enemy of
every sort of affectation, and the honest and liberal
judge of himself and others. He died in poverty,
though not in extreme want, at Madrid, in 1616, in
the sixty-ninth year of his age. He was buried
privately, without any kind of distinction, and not
even a common tomb-stone marks the spot where the
ashes of Cervantes repose.</p>

<p id="BRIEF_CHARACTER_OF_DON_QUIXOTE">Were we to arrange the works of Cervantes according
to their merits, the first place must be assigned
to Don Quixote, which is moreover entitled to the
supremacy, inasmuch as it is single in its kind.</p>

<p>To enter into a description of the contents of this
universally known master-piece, or to give a circumstantial
analysis of its plan, would be equally superfluous.
A few words, however, on the happy and
original idea which forms the foundation of the whole
work may here be introduced. It has often been said,
though the opinion has, perhaps, not been fully weighed,
nor even expressed with sufficient precision, that the
venerable knight of La Mancha is the immortal representative
of all men of exalted imagination, who carry
the noblest enthusiasm to a pitch of folly; because with
understandings in other respects sound, they are unable
to resist the fascinating power of a self-deception, by
which they are induced to regard themselves as beings
of a superior order. None but an experienced observer
of mankind, endowed with profound judgment, and a
genius to the penetrating glance of which one of the most
interesting recesses of the human heart had been newly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
disclosed, could have seized the idea of such a romance
with energetic decision. None but a poet and a man
of wit could have thrown so much poetic interest into
the execution of that idea; and none but an author who
had at his disposal all the richness and variety of one of
the finest languages in the world, could have diffused
over such a work that classical perfection of expression,
which gives the stamp of excellence to the whole.
The originality of the idea of Don Quixote is not only
historically demonstrated, by no romance of a similar
kind having previously existed&mdash;for pictures of ingenious
roguery in the style of Lazarillo de Tormes, belong to
a totally different species of comic romance&mdash;but it is
also physiologically certain, that a creative fancy, which
was only capable of continuing to invent where another
had stopt, could not, with the boldness of Cervantes,
have combined traits, apparently heterogeneous, in order
thereby to exhaust to the utmost the idea by which he
was inspired. Those who are acquainted with Don
Quixote only through the medium of the common
translations, will not certainly be inclined to regard
it as a work of inspiration, in the highest sense of the
word. But it is impossible to form a more mistaken
notion of this work, than to consider it merely as a
satire, intended by the author to ridicule the absurd
passion for reading old romances of chivalry. Doubtless
this is one of the objects which Cervantes had in
view; for among the romances which the Spanish public
indefatigably perused, few were tolerable, and only one
or two possessed first-rate merit. We must not, however,
attribute to him the absurd conceit of wishing to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
prove the prejudicial influence, which the reading of
bad romances produced on the taste of the Spanish
nation, by exhibiting the individual folly of an enthusiast,
who would have been just as likely to have lost
his senses by the study of Plato or Aristotle, as by the
reading of romances of chivalry. The merit and the
richness of the idea of a man of elevated character,
excited by heroic and enthusiastic feelings to the extravagant
pitch of wishing to restore the age of chivalry,
must be regarded as the seed of inspiration whence the
whole work originated. As a poet, Cervantes was
aware of the resources which this idea furnished; and
he must also have been satisfied with his power to prosecute
it, as he has proved in the execution what he
was capable of accomplishing. In the invention of a
series of comic situations in the most burlesque style,
he found full scope for the exercise of his fancy. The
painting of these situations afforded opportunities for
the free and energetic developement of his poetic talent.
Finally, he knew how to combine the knowledge
of human nature, which he had acquired during a life
of fifty years, with the most delicate satire, so as to render
his comic romance also a book of moral instruction,
to which no parallel existed. These brief remarks on
the idea which forms the foundation of the romance of
Don Quixote, must be allowed to supply the place of a
detailed analysis of the manner in which that celebrated
work is composed. Other critics have sufficiently
proved that the composition is by no means faultless.
In the preface to the second part, Cervantes has himself
pointed out some inadvertences which produce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
incongruities in the history, but he disdained to correct
them, because he conceived that they had been too severely
condemned.</p>

<p>The character of the execution of this comic romance,
is no less original than the invention. Character
in the strictest sense of the term is here meant.
The superficial sketches of a sportive fancy, for which
the Spaniards in the age of Cervantes entertained so high
a predilection, had not sufficient interest for him. He
felt a passion for the vivid painting of character, as all
his successful works prove. Under the influence of this
feeling, he not only drew the natural and striking portrait
of his heroic Don Quixote, so truly noble-minded,
and so enthusiastic an admirer of every thing good and
great, yet having all those fine qualities, accidentally
blended with a relative kind of madness; but he likewise
pourtrayed, with no less fidelity, the opposite character
of Sancho Panza, a compound of grossness and
simplicity, whose low selfishness leads him to place
blind confidence in all the extravagant hopes and promises
of his master. The subordinate characters of the
great picture exhibit equal truth and decision: but the
characteristic tone of the whole is still more remarkable.
A translator cannot commit a more serious injury
to Don Quixote, than to dress that work in a light
anecdotical style. A style perfectly unostentatious and
free from affectation, but at the same time solemn, and
penetrated, as it were, with the character of the hero,
diffuses over this comic romance an imposing air,
which, were it not so appropriate, would seem to belong
exclusively to serious works, and which is certainly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
difficult to be seized in a translation. But it is precisely
this solemnity of language, which imparts a characteristic
relief to the comic scenes. It is the genuine style
of the old romances of chivalry, improved and applied in
a totally original way; and only where the dialogue style
occurs is each person found to speak, as he might be
expected to do, and in his own peculiar manner. But
wherever Don Quixote himself harangues, the language
re-assumes the venerable tone of the romance style;<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a>
and various uncommon expressions of which the hero
avails himself, serve to complete the delusion of his
covetous squire, to whom they are only half intelligible.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a>
This characteristic tone diffuses over the whole a poetic
colouring, which distinguishes Don Quixote from all
comic romances in the ordinary style; and that poetic
colouring is moreover heightened by the judicious choice
of episodes. The essential connection of these episodes
with the whole has sometimes escaped the observation
of critics, who have regarded, as merely parenthetical,
those parts in which Cervantes has most decidedly
manifested the poetic spirit of his work. The novel
of <i>El Curioso Impertinente</i>, cannot indeed be ranked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
among the number of these essential episodes; but the
charming story of the shepherdess Marcella, the history
of Dorothea, and the history of the rich Camacho and
the poor Basilio, are unquestionably connected with the
interest of the whole. These serious romantic parts,
which are not, it is true, essential to the historical connection,
but strictly belong to the characteristic dignity
of the whole picture, also prove how far Cervantes was
from the idea usually attributed to him of writing a
book merely to excite laughter. The passages which
common readers feel inclined to pass over, are, in general,
precisely those in which Cervantes has shewn himself
more a poet, and for which he has manifested an evident
predilection. On such occasions he also introduces
among his prose, episodical verses, which are for the most
part excellent in their kind, and which no translator can
omit without doing violence to the spirit of the original.</p>

<p>Were it not for the happy art with which Cervantes
has contrived to preserve an intermediate tone
between pure poetry and prose, Don Quixote would
not deserve to be cited as the first classic model of the
modern romance or novel. It is, however, fully entitled
to that distinction. Cervantes was the first
writer who formed the genuine romance of modern
times on the model of the original chivalrous romance,
that equivocal creation of the genius and the barbarous
taste of the middle ages. The result has proved that
modern taste, however readily it may in other respects
conform to the rules of the antique, nevertheless requires
in the narration of fictitious events, a certain
union of poetry with prose which was unknown to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
Greeks and Romans in their best literary ages. It was
only necessary to seize on the right tone, but that was
a point of delicacy which the inventors of romances
of chivalry were not able to comprehend. Diego de
Mendoza, in his Lazarillo de Tormes, departed too far
from poetry. Cervantes, in his Don Quixote, restored
to the poetic art the place it was entitled to hold in
this class of writing: and he must not be blamed if
cultivated nations have subsequently mistaken the true
spirit of his work, because their own novelists had led
them to regard common prose as the style peculiarly
suited to romance composition. Don Quixote is moreover
the undoubted prototype of the comic novel. The
humorous situations are, it is true, almost all burlesque,
which was certainly not necessary, but the
satire is frequently so delicate, that it escapes rather
than obtrudes on unpractised attention; as for example
in the whole picture of the administration of Sancho
Panza in his imaginary island. Besides, the language
even in the description of the most burlesque situations,
never degenerates into vulgarity. Throughout
the whole work it is in general noble, correct, and so
highly polished, that it would not disgrace even an
ancient classic of the first rank.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> This explanation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
of a part of the merits of a work, which has been so
often wrongly judged, may, perhaps, seem to belong
rather to the eulogist than the calm and impartial
historian. Let those who may be inclined to form
this opinion, study Don Quixote in the original language,
and study it rightly, for it is not a book to be
judged by a superficial perusal. But care must be
taken that the intervention of many subordinate traits,
which were intended to have only a transient national
interest, does not produce an error in the estimate of
the whole.</p>

<p id="THE_MORAL_TALES_OF_CERVANTES">It would be scarcely possible to arrange the other
works of Cervantes according to a critical judgment
of their importance; for the merits of some consist in
the admirable finish of the whole, while others exhibit
the impress of genius in the invention, or some other
individual feature. A distinguished place must, however,
be assigned to the <i>Novelas Exemplares</i> (Moral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
or Instructive Tales.) They are unequal in merit as
well as in character. Cervantes, doubtless, intended
that they should be to the Spaniards nearly what the
novels of Boccacio were to the Italians: some are
mere anecdotes, some are romances in miniature, some
are serious, some comic, and all are written in a light,
smooth, conversational style. With regard to the
practical knowledge which these novels are intended
to convey to the reader, Cervantes has effected more
than Boccacio; and at all events he extended the
literature of his country by their publication, for
no similar compositions had previously existed in the
Spanish language. In them Cervantes has again
proved himself the experienced judge of mankind,
and has given, with admirable success, truly genuine
and judicious representations of nature, in the various
situations of real life. The reader must naturally
feel inclined to pardon the want of plan which
this little collection of novels occasionally exhibits,
when he finds that the author through the medium
of his characters relates and describes all that he had
himself seen and experienced under similar circumstances,
particularly during his abode in Italy and
Africa. The history of the <i>Licenciado Vidriera</i>, (the
Glass Licentiate) which is the fifth in the collection,
is totally destitute of plan, and is related in simple
prose like a common anecdote. But the novel of <i>La
Gitanilla</i>, (the Gipsey Girl) is ingeniously conceived
and poetically coloured; and the same may be said
of some others. The story of <i>Rinconete y Cortadilla</i>,
or the Lurker and the Cutter, as the names with reference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
to their etymology may be translated,<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> is a comic
romance in miniature.</p>

<p id="THE_GALATEA"><i>Galatea</i>, the pastoral romance which Cervantes
wrote in his youth, is a happy imitation of the Diana
of Montemayor, but exhibiting a still closer resemblance
to Gil Polo’s continuation of that poem.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a>
Next to Don Quixote and the <i>Novelas Exemplares</i>,
this pastoral romance is particularly worthy of attention,
as it manifests in a striking way the poetic
direction in which the genius of Cervantes moved even
at an early period of life, and from which he never
entirely departed in his subsequent writings. As,
however, the Galatea possesses but little originality, it
constantly excites the recollection of its models, and
particularly of the Diana of Gil Polo. Of the invention
of the fable likewise, but little can be said, for though
the story is continued through six books, it is still
incomplete. In composing this pastoral romance, Cervantes
seems to have had no other object than to
clothe in the popular garb of a tale, a rich collection
of poems in the old Spanish and Italian styles, which
he could not have presented to the public under a more
agreeable form. The story is merely the thread which
holds the beautiful garland together; for the poems are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
the portion of the work most particularly deserving
attention. They are as numerous as they are various:
and should the title of Cervantes to rank, with respect
to verse as well as to prose, among the most eminent
poets, or his originality in versified composition, be
called in question, an attentive perusal of the romance
of Galatea must banish every doubt on these points.
It was remarked by the contemporaries of Cervantes
that he was incapable of writing poetry, and that he
could compose only beautiful prose; but that observation
had reference solely to his dramatic works.
Every critic, sufficiently acquainted with his lyrical
compositions, has rendered justice to their merits.
From the romance of Galatea it is obvious that Cervantes
composed in all the various kinds of syllabic
measure which were used in his time. He even occasionally
adopted the old dactylic stanza.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> He
appears to have experienced some difficulty in the
metrical form of the sonnet, and his essays in that
style are by no means numerous;<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> but his poems in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
Italian octaves display the utmost facility; and among
the number, the song of Calliope in the last book
of the Galatea is remarkable for the graceful ease of
the versification.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> In the same manner as Gil Polo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
in his Diana makes the river Turia pronounce the
praises of the celebrated Valencians, the poetic fancy
of Cervantes summoned the muse Calliope before the
shepherds and shepherdesses, to render solemn homage
to those contemporaries whom he esteemed worthy of
distinction as poets. But the critic can scarcely venture
to place reliance on praises which are dealt out
with such profuse liberality. The most beautiful poems
in the Galatea are a few in the cancion style, some
of which are in iambics,<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> and some in trochaic or old
Spanish verse.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> Cervantes has here and there indulged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
in those antiquated and fantastic plays of wit,
which at a subsequent period he himself ridiculed.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a>
The prose of the Galatea, which is in other respects
so beautiful, is also occasionally overloaded with a sort
of epithetical ostentation.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<p id="THE_JOURNEY_TO_PARNASSUS">Cervantes displays a totally different kind of poetic
talent in the <i>Viage al Parnaso</i>, (Journey to Parnassus)
a work which cannot properly be ranked in any
particular class of literary composition, but which, next
to Don Quixote, is the most exquisite production of its
extraordinary author. The chief object of the poem is
to satirize the false pretenders to the honours of the
Spanish Parnassus, who lived in the age of the author.
But this satire is of a peculiar character: it is a most
happy effusion of sportive humour, and it yet remains a
matter of doubt whether Cervantes intended to praise
or to ridicule the individuals whom he points out as
being particularly worthy of the favour of Apollo. He
himself says&mdash;“Those whose names do not appear in
this list, may be just as well pleased as those who are
mentioned in it.” To characterize true poetry according
to his own poetic feelings; to manifest in a decided
way his enthusiasm for the art even in his old age; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
to hold up a mirror for the conviction of those who
were only capable of making rhymes and inventing
extravagances, seem to have been the objects which
Cervantes had principally in view when he composed
this satirical poem. Concealed satire, open jesting, and
ardent enthusiasm for the beautiful, are the boldly
combined elements of this noble work. It is divided
into eight chapters, and the versification is in tercets.
The composition is half comic and half serious. After
many humorous incidents, Mercury appears to Cervantes,
who is represented as travelling to Parnassus in the
most miserable condition; and the god salutes him
with the title of the “Adam of poets.”<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> Mercury
after addressing to him many flattering compliments,
conducts him to a ship entirely built of different kinds
of verse, and which is intended to convey a cargo of
Spanish poets to the kingdom of Apollo. The description
of the ship is an admirable comic allegory.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Mercury shews him a list of the poets with whom
Apollo wishes to become acquainted; and this list,
owing to the problematic nature of its half ironical and
half serious praises, has proved a stumbling block to
commentators. In the midst of the reading Cervantes
suddenly drops the list. The poets are now described
as crowding on board the ship in numbers as countless as
drops of rain in a shower, or grains of sand on the sea
coast; and such a tumult ensues, that to save the ship
from sinking by their pressure, the sirens raise a furious
storm. The flights of imagination become more wild
as the story advances. The storm subsides, and is succeeded
by a shower of poets, that is to say, poets fall
from the clouds. One of the first who descends on
the ship is Lope de Vega, on whom Cervantes seizes
this opportunity of pronouncing a pompous eulogium.
The remainder of the poem, a complete analysis of
which would occupy too much space, proceeds in the
same spirit. One of the most beautiful pieces of verse
ever written by Cervantes, is his description of the
goddess Poesy, whom he sees in all her glory in the
kingdom of Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> To this fine picture the portrait
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
of the goddess Vain-Glory, who afterwards appears to
the author in a dream, forms an excellent companion.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a>
Among the passages which for burlesque humour vie
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
with Don Quixote is the description of a second storm,
in which Neptune vainly endeavours to plunge the
poetasters to the bottom of the deep. Venus prevents
them from sinking, by changing them into empty
gourds and leather bottles.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> At length a formal battle
is fought between the real poets and some of the
poetasters. The poem is throughout interspersed with
singularly witty and beautiful ideas; and only a very
few passages can be charged with feebleness or langour.
It has never been equalled, far less surpassed by any
similar work, and it had no prototype. The language
is classical throughout; and it is only to be regretted,
that Cervantes has added to the poem a comic supplement
in prose, in which he indulges a little too freely
in self-praise.</p>

<p id="DRAMATIC_WORKS_OF_CERVANTES">The dramatic compositions of Cervantes, were they
all extant, would be the most voluminous, though, certainly,
not the best portion of his works. Perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
those which are now lost may yet be recovered; for a
fortunate accident brought to light two dramas, which
had remained concealed in manuscript till near the end
of the eighteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> Cervantes includes some
of his dramas among those productions with which he
was himself most satisfied; and he seems to have
regarded them with the greater self-complacency in
proportion as they experienced the neglect of the
public.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> This conduct has sometimes been attributed
to a spirit of contradiction, and sometimes to vanity.
The editor of the eight plays (chiefly heroic) and eight
interludes, which were the last dramatic productions of
Cervantes, has adopted the absurd notion, that Cervantes
in writing these pieces, intended to parody and
ridicule the style of Lope de Vega;<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> which is merely
saying that he attacked the whole literary public of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
Spain in the most discourteous way. No traces of
parody appear in any of those dramas. They are,
however, with the exception of a few successful scenes,
so dull and tedious, that one might be inclined to regard
them as counterfeit productions by another author,
were it not that their authenticity seems to be sufficiently
proved. The little interludes alone exhibit burlesque
humour and dramatic spirit. That the penetrating
and profound Cervantes should have so mistaken
the limits of his dramatic talent, would not be sufficiently
accounted for even by his vanity, had he not
unquestionably proved by his tragedy of Numantia how
pardonable was the self-deception of which he could
not divest himself. Cervantes was entitled to consider
himself endowed with a genius for dramatic poetry.
But he could not preserve his independence in the conflict
he had to maintain with the conditions required
by the Spanish public in dramatic composition; and
when he sacrificed his independence, and submitted to
rules imposed by others, his invention and language
were reduced to the level of a poet of inferior talent.
The intrigues, adventures, and surprises which in that
age characterized the Spanish drama, were ill suited to
the genius of Cervantes. His natural style was too
profound and precise to be reconciled to fantastical
ideas, expressed in irregular verse. But he was Spaniard
enough to be gratified with dramas, which, as a
poet, he could not imitate; and he imagined himself
capable of imitating them, because he would have shone
in another species of dramatic composition, had the
public taste accommodated itself to his genius.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span></p>

<p>With all its imperfections and faults, Cervantes’s
tragedy of Numantia is a noble production, and, like
Don Quixote, it is unparalleled in the class of literature
to which it belongs. It proves that under different
circumstances the author of Don Quixote might have
been the Æschylus of Spain. The conception is in
the style of the boldest pathos, and the execution, at
least taken as a whole, is vigorous and dignified. The
ancient Roman History from which Cervantes selected
the story of the destruction of Numantia, afforded but
few positive facts of which he could avail himself in
his heroic tragedy. He therefore invented along with
the subject of his piece a peculiar style of tragic composition,
in doing which he did not pay much regard
to the theory of Aristotle. His object was to produce
a piece full of tragic situations, combined with the
charm of the marvellous. The tragedy is written in
conformity with no rules save those which Cervantes
prescribed to himself; for he felt no inclination to imitate
the Greek forms. The play is divided into four
acts (<i>jornadas</i>), and no chorus is introduced. The
dialogue is sometimes in tercets, and sometimes in redondillas,
and for the most part in octaves, without any
regard to rule. The diction does not maintain equal
dignity throughout; but it is in no instance affected or
bombastic. Cervantes has evinced admirable skill in
gradually heightening the tragic interest to the close of
the piece. The commencement is, however, somewhat
cold and tedious. Scipio appears with his generals in
the Roman camp before Numantia. In a speech which
might have been improved by abridgment, he reprimands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
his troops, whose spirit has begun to give way
to effeminacy. The soldiers are re-inspired with courage.
Numantian ambassadors enter with proposals
for peace, which are rejected. It is here that the
tragedy properly begins. Spain appears as an allegorical
character, and she summons the river Duero,
or Durius, on whose banks Numantia stands. The old
river god appears, attended by a retinue of the deities
of the smaller rivers of the surrounding country.
These ideal characters consult the book of fate, and
discover that Numantia cannot be saved. Whatever
may be said against the bold idea of endeavouring to
augment the tragic pathos by means of allegorical
characters, it must be acknowledged that in this case
the result of the experiment is not altogether unsuccessful,
and Cervantes justly prides himself in the
novelty of the idea. The scene is now transferred to
Numantia. The senate is assembled to deliberate on
the affairs of the city, and among the members the
character of Theagenes shines with conspicuous lustre.
Bold resolutions are adopted by the senate. The transition
into light redondillas, for the purpose of interweaving
with the serious business of the fable, the
loves of a young Numantian named Morandro, and his
mistress, is certainly a fault in the composition of the
tragedy. But to this fault we are indebted for some of
the finest scenes in the following act. A solemn sacrifice
is prepared; but amidst the ceremony an evil spirit
appears, seizes the victim, and extinguishes the fire.
The confusion in the town increases. A dead man is
resuscitated by magic, and the scene in which this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
incident occurs has a most imposing effect.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> All hope
has now vanished. After the return of a second
unsuccessful embassy, the Numantians, by the advice
of Theagenes, resolve to burn all their valuable
property, then to put their wives and children to
death, and lastly to throw themselves in the flames,
lest any of the inhabitants of the town should become
the slaves of the Romans. Scenes of the most
heart-rending domestic misery, and the noblest traits
of patriotism then ensue.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> Famine rages in Numantia.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
Morandro, accompanied by one of his friends, ventures
to enter the Roman camp. He returns with a piece
of bread smeared with blood, and, presenting it to his
famished mistress, falls at her feet mortally wounded.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
The action proceeds with unabated interest to the end.
An allegorical character of Fame enters at the close of
the piece, and announces the future glory of Spain.</p>

<p>Allegorical characters, for instance, Necessity and
Opportunity, likewise appear in Cervantes’s comedy,
<i>El Trato de Argel</i> (Life in Algiers, or Manners in
Algiers). But their introduction amidst scenes of common
life injures the story, which is besides by no means
ingenious, and imparts a cold and whimsical character
to the piece. This comedy, however, which is divided
into five acts, is not destitute of interest and spirit.</p>

<p id="THE_ROMANCE_OF_PERSILES_AND_SIGISMUNDA">The romance of Persiles and Sigismunda, which
Cervantes finished shortly before his death, must be
regarded as an interesting appendix to his other works.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a>
The language and the whole composition of the story,
exhibit the purest simplicity, combined with singular
precision and polish. The idea of this romance was
not new, and scarcely deserved to be reproduced in a
new manner. But it appears that Cervantes at the
close of his glorious career took a fancy to imitate
Heliodorus. He has maintained the interest of the
situations, but the whole work is merely a romantic
description of travels, rich enough in frightful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
adventures, both by sea and land. Real and fabulous
geography and history are mixed together in an absurd
and monstrous manner; and the second half of the romance,
in which the scene is transferred to Spain and
Italy, does not exactly harmonize with the spirit of the
first half.</p>

<p>If we cast a glance on the collected works of Cervantes,
in order to ascertain what their author was
entitled to claim as his original property, independently
of his contemporaries and predecessors, we shall find that
the genius of that poet, who is in general only partially
estimated, shines with the brighter lustre the longer it
is contemplated. That kind of criticism which is to be
learnt, contributed but little to the developement and
formation of his genius. A critical tact, which is a
truer guide than any rule, but which abandons genius
when it forgets itself, secured the fancy of Cervantes
against the aberrations of common minds, and his
sportive wit was always subject to the control of solid
judgment. The vanity which occasionally made him
mistake the true bent of his talent, must be confessed
to have been pardonable, considering how little he was
known to his contemporaries. He did not even know
himself, though he felt the consciousness of his genius.
From the mental height to which he had raised himself,
he might, without too highly rating his own abilities,
look down on all the writers of his age. More than one
poet of great, of immortal genius, might be placed beside
him in his own country; but of all the Spanish poets
Cervantes alone belongs to the whole world.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span></p>

<h3 id="LOPE_DE_VEGA">LOPE DE VEGA.</h3>

<p>Lope Felix de Vega Carpio, the rival and conqueror
of Cervantes in the conflict of dramatic art,
was born at Madrid, in the year 1562. He was consequently
fifteen years younger than Cervantes. Marvellous
stories are related respecting the early developement
of his poetic genius and his talent for composing
verses. Though his parents were not rich, yet he
received a literary education; and he is also said to
have distinguished himself in corporeal exercises. He
lost his parents before he was old enough to attend
the university; but through the assistance of Don
Geronymo Manrique, the grand inquisitor, and Bishop of
Avila, who was much attached to him, he was enabled
to complete a course of philosophy at Alcala. After
obtaining his degree at that university, he returned to
Madrid, where he became secretary to the Duke of Alba.
He shortly afterwards married; and from this period,
which seemed to promise a career of tranquil happiness,
the stormy vicissitudes of his life commenced. He
became engaged in a quarrel, fought a duel, wounded
his antagonist dangerously, and was obliged to fly.
For several years he lived an exile from Madrid; and
on his return his wife unfortunately died. Harrassed
by this series of calamities, and being as warm a patriot
as he was a sincere catholic, he entered into one of the
military corps which were embarked on board the invincible
armada for the invasion of England. Though he
himself returned in safety to Madrid, yet he was deeply
grieved at the ill success of the armada. His vigorous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
constitution, however, enabled him to keep up his spirits;
he again became a secretary, once more entered into
the married state, and passed some time in uninterrupted
domestic happiness. On the death of his second wife,
who survived her marriage only a few years, he resolved
to forego the pleasures of the world, and for that purpose
took holy orders. He did not, however, retire to a
convent; but he devoted himself wholly to the study of
poetry,&mdash;to that study, which from childhood upwards,
had principally engrossed his mind, and in the active
prosecution of which he produced so extraordinary a
result, that it is difficult to conceive how any man could
even during the most protracted existence, write as
much as Lope de Vega: and yet he spent a part of his
life in civil business, and in the discharge of military
duties. He composed in all the various kinds of verse
which were in use in his time; and he succeeded in all.
But his dramas in particular were received with an
enthusiasm which the labours of no other Spanish
poet had ever excited. He so precisely struck the
chord which harmonized with the taste of the Spanish
public, that he has been worshipped as the inventor of
the national comedy, though he only pursued the tract
which Torres Naharro originally opened.</p>

<p>Lope de Vega’s fertility of invention is as unparalleled
in the history of poetry, as the talent which
enabled him to compose regular and well constructed
verses with as much facility as if he had been writing
prose. Cervantes styles him <i>el monstruo de naturaleza</i>,
(the prodigy of nature) and this name was not given
him merely in levity. He was constrained by no rules
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
of criticism; not that he was ignorant of the theory
of the ancient poetry, but he took delight in letting
his verses flow freely from his pen, confident in the
success of whatever he might produce. The public,
he observed, paid for the drama, and he thought it but
fair that those who paid should be served with that
which suited their taste. Lope de Vega required no
more than four-and-twenty hours to write a versified
drama of three acts in redondillas, interspersed with
sonnets, tercets and octaves, and from beginning to
end abounding in intrigues, prodigies, or interesting
situations. This astonishing facility enabled him to
supply the Spanish theatre with upwards of two
thousand original dramas, of which not more than
three hundred have been preserved by printing. In
general the theatrical manager carried away what he
wrote before he had even time to revise it; and immediately
a fresh applicant would arrive to prevail on
him to commence a new piece. He sometimes wrote
a play in the short space of three or four hours. The
profits which the theatrical managers derived from the
writings of Lope de Vega, enabled them to bestow
such liberal payment on the author, that at one time
he is supposed to have been possessed of upwards of a
hundred thousand ducats. But he did not long preserve
his fortune, though from the commencement of
his celebrity he always possessed enough to enable him
to live with comfort. His purse was ever open to the
poor of Madrid.</p>

<p>But Lope de Vega’s poetic talent procured him
even more glory than gain. No Spanish poet was ever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
so much honoured during his life. The nobility and
the public vied in expressing their admiration of him.
He was chosen president (<i>capellan mayor</i>) of the
spiritual college of Madrid, of which he had previously
been admitted as a member. Pope Urban VIII.
sent him the cross of Malta, and the degree of doctor
of theology, accompanied by a flattering letter. The
pope also appointed him fiscal of the apostolic chamber.
For these distinctions Lope de Vega was not indebted
merely to his poetic talents. No Spanish poet of celebrity
had hitherto manifested in his writings such
enthusiastic interest for the triumph of the catholic
religion. He was accordingly appointed familiar to the
inquisition, a post which was at that period regarded
as singularly honourable. But the Spanish public
adopted another mode of expressing their admiration
of their favourite dramatist. Whenever Lope de Vega
appeared in the streets, he was surrounded by crowds
of people, all eager to gain a sight of the prodigy of
nature. The boys ran shouting after him, and those
who could not keep pace with the rest, stood and gazed
on him with wonder as he passed. He died in 1631,
in the sixty-third year of his age. His funeral was
conducted with princely magnificence. The ceremony
was directed by his patron, the Duke of Susa, whom he
appointed executor of his will. The music of the high
mass which was celebrated at his funeral, was executed
by the performers of the chapel royal. During the
exequies, which lasted three days, three bishops officiated
in their pontifical robes. The memory of the
“Spanish Phenix,” as he was usually styled by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
publishers of his plays, was celebrated with no less
pomp in all the theatres of Spain. Arithmetical calculations
have been employed, in order to arrive at a
just estimate of Lope de Vega’s facility in poetic composition.
According to his own testimony, he wrote
on an average five sheets per day; it has therefore been
computed that the number of sheets which he composed
during his life, must have amounted to one hundred
and thirty-three thousand, two hundred and twenty-five,
and that allowing for the deduction of a small portion
of prose, Lope de Vega must have written upwards of
twenty-one millions, three hundred thousand verses.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p id="GENERAL_CHARACTERISTICS_OF_HIS_POETRY">Nature would have overstepped her bounds and
have produced the miraculous, had Lope de Vega, along
with this rapidity of invention and composition, attained
perfection in any department of literature. Nature,
however, did her utmost for Lope de Vega; for even
the rudest, most incorrect, and verbose of his works,
are imbued with a poetic spirit which no methodical
art can create. This poetic spirit is, at the
same time so national and so completely Spanish, that
without an intimate acquaintance with the works
of other Spanish poets, and particularly those who
flourished at an early period, it is impossible to perceive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
Lope de Vega’s merits and defects, or to understand their
connection with each other. On this account, however,
he was in a peculiar manner the poet of the Spanish public,
the favourite of all ranks; and on this account have
his writings always been partially or erroneously judged.</p>

<p id="EXPLANATION_OF_THE_IDEA_OF_A_SPANISH_COMEDY">Lope de Vega was born for dramatic poetry. In
every other class of composition, he was merely an
accurate imitator, or if he struck out a new course, it
was in so imperfect a way, that his example was injurious
to the cause of literature. But as a dramatic
poet, if he did not create the Spanish comedy, properly
so called, his inexhaustible fancy and the fascinating
ease of his animated composition confirmed to it that
character which has since distinguished it. All subsequent
Spanish dramatic poets trod in the footsteps
of Lope de Vega, until genius was banished from the
sphere it occupied by the introduction of the French
taste in Spain. The successors of Lope de Vega
merely improved on the models which he had created.
He fixed for a century and a half the spirit and the
style of nearly all the different kinds of dramatic entertainment
in Spain. It may therefore be proper to
unite with a notice of the dramatic works of Lope
de Vega, a sketch of the characteristics of the various
species of plays then performed in Spain; and this sketch
will at the same time serve as a key to all the peculiarities
of the Spanish drama.</p>

<p>Since the age of Lope de Vega, the word comedy
(<i>comedia</i>) has had in the dramatic language of Spain
a totally different signification from that which was
attached to it by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
which it retains in most countries of modern Europe.
It is the generic name of several species of drama,
some of which, according to our established notions,
are neither comedies nor tragedies; but all of which
approximate to one common spirit of invention and
execution. The critic will inevitably form an erroneous
judgment of these works, if he be guided by notions
deduced from the Greek and Roman drama, and which,
with certain limitations, are applicable to all dramatic
compositions except the Spanish comedy. The spirit of
the Spanish comedy must not be sought for in that
popular satire, which constitutes the very essence of
the ancient and modern comedy, properly so called.
The compositions in which it is to be found are of
a totally different nature. In them stories of country
and city life are clothed in romantic poetic colours, and
blended with the interesting inventions of a bold and
irregular fancy, without any distinction between the
gay and the serious, or the comic and the tragic. In a
word, a Spanish comedy is in its principle a dramatic
novel; and as there are tragic, comic, historical, and
purely imaginative novels, so, in like manner, the
Spanish comedy readily adopts those various modes of
exciting interest on the stage. In Spanish comedies as
in novels, princes and potentates are no more out of
place than jockeys and fops; and these dissimilar characters
may all be introduced on the stage at once,
should the progress of the intrigue require so heterogeneous
an approximation. Satire is therefore merely
an agreeable accessary in the Spanish comedy, of which
the poet may avail himself at his pleasure. In these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
comedies the powerful delineation of character is no
more essential than in novels. Even a motley combination
of burlesque and serious, vulgar and pathetic
scenes, is not hostile to the spirit of a Spanish comedy,
the object of which is not to maintain the interest in a
particular direction. The subject of the piece may
be a moving or a horrific story; still the picture presented
is entertaining, but entertaining in a manner
totally different from that kind of comedy which exhibits
the follies of life in a satirical point of view. A
continuance of the pathetic or the horrific would be as
little congenial to the spirit of those dramatic novels
which the Spaniards call comedies, as a continuance of
the ludicrous. In this is manifested the first of the
peculiar conditions required by the Spanish public, of
which notice has already been taken in treating of the
origin of the Spanish comedy. With any other people
than the Spaniards these dramatic novels would have
assumed a somewhat different character, without, however,
departing from their original spirit. But this
class of dramatic composition, which admits of the
most singular mixture of the pompous and the ludicrous,
was particularly suited to the Spaniards of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as by it they were
relieved from any long duration of serious impressions.
With this first requisite of a changeable dramatic form,
which Lope de Vega completely satisfied, was associated
a second. A complicated plot was indispensable in every
drama, the subject of which was drawn from the sphere
of common life. As a substitute for that sort of plot
in historical comedies, extraordinary and striking adventures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
were introduced, and in spiritual comedies, miracles.
According to the universally received notion of
a Spanish comedy, in Lope de Vega’s time, no distinction
was made between the sacred and the profane
styles; for a legend was dramatized as a spiritual novel.</p>

<p>Whether a nation which was satisfied with such
comedies did or did not beguile itself of the purest
and most perfect developement of dramatic genius, is
a question for separate discussion. But the Spanish
comedy considered in all its modifications, as a particular
species of drama, may stand the test of sound
criticism; and Lope de Vega in a great measure contributed
to fix the national taste in these modifications.
In his time the classification was first made of sacred
and profane dramas, or as the Spaniards called them,
<i>comedias Divinas y Humanas</i>. The profane comedies
were again divided into <i>comedias Heroycas</i>, (Heroic
comedies); and <i>comedias de Capa y Espada</i>, (comedies
of the Cloak and Sword.) The heroic comedies were
originally the same as the historical, but the title was
subsequently extended to mythological and allegorical
dramas. The comedies of the <i>Capa y Espada</i>, were
founded on subjects selected from the sphere of fashionable
life, and exhibited the manners of the age; they were
likewise performed in the costume of the times. At
a later period a subdivision of these <i>comedias de Capa
y Espada</i> was formed under the name of <i>comedias de
Figuròn</i>, because the principal character was either
a needy adventurer representing himself as a rich
nobleman, or a lady of the same class. In Lope de
Vega’s time also, the sacred comedies began to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
divided into dramatized <i>Vidas de Santos</i> and <i>Autos
Sacramentales</i>. Both classes were founded on the
model of the dramas, which used to be represented in
the cloisters. The <i>Autos Sacramentales</i>, which had
all a reference to the administration of the sacrament,
according to catholic notions, seem to have had their
origin in the age of Lope de Vega; at least in the prelude
to one of his <i>Autos</i> (the word literally signifies
acts) a countrywoman questions her husband respecting
the nature of these dramas.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> Finally, to the different
kinds of Spanish comedy existing in Lope de Vega’s
age, must be added the little preludes or recommendatory
pieces, called <i>loas</i>, and the interludes, or <i>entremeses</i>,
introduced between the prelude and the principal
comedy, and which when interspersed with music
and dancing, are denominated <i>saynetes</i>.</p>

<p id="VARIOUS_SPECIES_OF_DRAMAS_BY_THIS_POET">Heroic and historical comedies form a considerable
portion of the dramatic works of Lope de Vega, in so
far as they have been preserved. The tragic scenes in
many of these comedies, so well harmonized with the
national taste of the Spaniards, that they readily dispensed
with genuine tragedy; and as vivid a recollection
of the old national history was maintained by these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
theatrical representations as by the old romances. But
few of Lope’s historical comedies relate, like his <i>Gran
Duque de Moscovia</i>, to foreign subjects. In point of
composition, his dramas do not materially differ one
from the other. Even in his historical pieces, he uses
such freedoms with respect to the unity of action, that
only a slight similitude connects the acts and scenes
together; and he totally disregards the unities of time
and place. The execution of these dramas is no less
irregular than their composition. According to the
humour in which the author happened to be when
engaged in his literary labour, his descriptions and
language are vigorous or feeble, noble or mean, unpolished
or highly refined. A description of <i>Las
Almenas de Toro</i> (the Battlements of Toro), one of
the best productions in the class to which it belongs,
will afford a tolerably correct idea of Lope de Vega’s
historical comedies. The subject of this piece is the
murder of King Don Sancho, by Bellido Dolfos, a knight
whom the king had offended by a violation of his promise,
a story which has likewise furnished materials for
several old romances. The Cid Ruy Diaz is a principal
character in this comedy, which, like all others of the
same kind, is divided into three acts.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> The scene opens
with a view of the country before the strongly fortified
town of Toro in Leon. The King Don Sancho, the Cid,
and a Count Anzures enter. The king explains to the
two knights, that state reasons prevent him from fulfilling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
his father’s will, and that he cannot leave his two
sisters, the infantas Elvira and Urraca, in possession of
the strong fortresses of Toro and Zamora.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> The Cid
with noble sincerity avows his opinion of the king’s
injustice towards his sisters, and offers himself as a
mediator in the dispute. The king and Count Anzures
retire. The Cid advances to the walls, and meets a
knight named Ordonez, who has just come out of the
fortress to execute some enterprize in favour of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
infanta Elvira. Both knights are about to draw; but
they recognize each other, and embrace. The Cid is
pourtrayed in all the greatness of his character.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> The
infanta appears on the walls, and states to the Cid her
reasons for not opening the gates to her brother. The
king re-appears, and orders preparations for storming
the garrison. The scene changes&mdash;Don Vela, an old
knight who has withdrawn from the tumult of public
life, appears in front of his country residence. He
communes with himself in a speech full of dignity
and beauty, but in some passages too poetical for the
drama.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> His daughter enters singing, and surrounded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
by a rustic group. This scene introduces a romantic
episode which is interwoven with the main action, and
the hero of which is a prince of Burgundy, disguised
as a peasant, who is enamoured of the daughter of Don
Vela. The scene again changes to the neighbourhood
of Toro. The infanta Elvira appears on the battlements,
and negotiations are once more set on foot.
The king himself holds a conversation with his sister,
which, however, produces no conciliatory result. This
brief, pointed, and not very courteous dialogue, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
interspersed with plays of wit on the word <i>Toro</i>, the
name of the fortress, which in Spanish signifies a bull.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a>
The king instantly commands scaling ladders to be
brought, and the storming of the fortress commences,
but the besiegers are repulsed. Thus the first act concludes.
With the commencement of the second act the
rural episode becomes more nearly allied to the main
action. A sonnet in which the disguised prince of
Burgundy, and his mistress Sancha, express their sentiments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
of mutual attachment, affords an instance of that
protracted kind of metaphor, which Lope de Vega
employed on such occasions, and which, a hundred
years afterwards, Metastasio likewise adopted in his
opera songs, as the poetic language of passion.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> Don
Bellido Dolfos prevails on the king to promise him the
hand of the infanta Elvira, on condition of his taking
the fortress. By dint of the vilest perfidy Bellido Dolfos
succeeds; but the king, who is of opinion that a traitor
should be rewarded with treachery, refuses to abide by
his promise. Bellido Dolfos meditates revenge. Meanwhile
Elvira escapes in the disguise of a peasant, and
takes refuge in the house of Don Vela. With this
combination of heroic and tender, domestic and rural
situations, the action proceeds, until Bellido Dolfos
murders the king; an incident, however, which does
not take place oh the stage. The infanta Elvira returns
to Toro, where she receives the homage of her people,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
and the prince of Burgundy avowing his real character,
is united to his beloved Sancha.</p>

<p>Lope de Vega’s <i>Comedias de Capa y Espada</i>, or
those which may properly be denominated his dramas of
intrigue, though wanting in the delineation of character,
are romantic pictures of manners, drawn from real life.
They present, in their peculiar style, no less interest with
respect to situations than his heroic comedies; and the
same irregularity in the composition of the scenes. The
language, too, is alternately elegant and vulgar, sometimes
highly poetic, and sometimes, though versified,
reduced to the level of the dullest prose. Lope de
Vega seems scarcely to have bestowed a thought on
maintaining probability in the succession of the different
scenes; ingenious complication is with him the
essential point in the interest of his situations. Intrigues
are twisted and entwined together, until the
poet, in order to bring his piece to a conclusion, without
ceremony cuts the knots he cannot untie; and then
he usually brings as many couples together as he can
by any possible contrivance match. He has scattered
through his pieces occasional reflections and maxims of
prudence, but any genuine morality which might be
conveyed through the stage, is wanting, for its introduction
would have been inconsistent with that poetic
freedom on which the dramatic interest of the Spanish
comedy is founded. His aim was to paint what he
observed, not what he would have approved, in the
manners of the fashionable world of his age; but he
leaves it to the spectator to draw his own inferences.
In this indirect way only, could the Spanish public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
tolerate useful applications in the drama; for the Spaniard
always considered the morality with which he
was occupied in church sufficient. An exuberant gallantry,
which may or may not be veiled by decorum,
and which is at all times only slightly restrained by
notions of honour, but never by a sense of moral duty,
constitutes the very essence of these dramas, <i>de Capa
y Espada</i>. Where the passion is vehement, it advances
with true Spanish ardour to the attainment of
its object; where it is tender and sentimental, the romantic
tirades and far-fetched plays of wit are inexhaustible.
That <i>love excuses every thing</i>, was at this
time the darling maxim of the gay world in Madrid;
and in conformity with its spirit, Lope de Vega’s young
heroes and heroines plunge headlong into intrigue.
Free scope is given to the basest artifice and perfidy;
the man of fashion draws his sword on the slightest
provocation; and whether he desperately wounds, or
even kills his adversary, is a matter of indifference.
Disguises, too, abound in these dramas. One of the
most interesting of Lope’s comedies in this class, is <i>La
Villana de Xetafe</i>, (the Peasant Girl of Xetafe, a
village in the vicinity of Madrid). It exhibits a series
of the boldest and most dexterous impostures, by means
of which the interesting heroine succeeds in entrapping
her lover, who is a man of condition, into the bonds of
matrimony. The confessors must have found some
difficulty in counteracting the ill effects which could
not fail to be occasionally produced by such examples,
though they were by no means set up as models. The
fascinating natural painting of these intrigues, which at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
the same time always possess a certain poetic elevation,
constitutes the chief charm of Lope de Vega’s comedies.
The deviation from nature in expression, which
has frequently been a subject of reproach to this prolific
writer, is in most instances merely attributable to negligence
or rapidity of composition. He faithfully embodies
the general forms of character, which, to be sure,
are all alike in the class of Spanish comedies now under
consideration. The <i>vejete</i> (old man), the <i>galan</i> (lover),
the <i>dama</i> (young lady), together with a suitable number
of servants and waiting women, are the standing characters
which are constantly introduced with no variety,
except in the situations; but at the same time, they are
drawn in such animated colours, that the perusal of one
or two of these dramas of intrigue is sufficient to render
the reader familiar with the whole world which the poet
describes. In Lope’s comedies, as in real life, the (<i>gracioso</i>)
buffoon and the fool are occasionally the same
character. They have also superfluous parts; personages
totally unconnected with the business of the drama are
sometimes introduced.</p>

<p>In order to afford an idea of the composition of this
portion of the dramatic works of Lope de Vega, we may
select, as a specimen, the comedy entitled, <i>La Viuda de
Valencia</i> (the Widow of Valencia). It is one of the
pieces of this master in the art of intrigue in which the
complication is best contrived, and it is besides remarkable
in the class to which it belongs for the unity which
is preserved in the action. The scene is laid in Valencia
in the time of the carnival. Leonarda, a young rich
and handsome widow, living according to her own fancy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
has resolved never to re-marry. She enters with a book
in her hand; for she reads works of all sorts, sacred and
profane, not from piety or love of literature, but merely
to amuse herself, while she never deigns to bestow a
thought on the suitors by whom she is surrounded. On
the subject of her reading she discourses very reasonably
with her waiting woman.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> Her arch attendant turns
the conversation in such a way, that the young widow,
with all her pretended wisdom, is induced to view herself
in a looking glass, and in the very act of doing so,
she is surprised by a visit from her uncle. The old
gentleman assures his fair niece, who is highly vexed at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
the surprise, that she does well to convince herself of
the power of her charms by such indisputable testimony.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a>
When, however, he begins to talk of marriage,
the lady contemptuously sketches a burlesque portrait
of a Madrid beau,<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> and describes, though in a less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
happy style the unfortunate consequences of an imprudent
match. The old uncle takes his leave, and
the scene changes, or rather it is transferred to the
other division of the stage. The three admirers of
the beautiful Leonarda meet each other in front of her
house. They express their wishes and hopes in sonnets,
the subjects of which are long-winded metaphors. As
none of the party can boast of his mistress’s favour,
they mutually acknowledge their ill success, and each
describes a burlesque adventure, which has occurred to
him during the night, in front of Leonarda’s house.
One relates, that under the supposition that he was
stabbing a rival, he thrust his poignard into a skin of
stolen wine.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> Meanwhile Leonarda hastily returns
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
from church, where she has seen a young gentleman
with whom she has fallen deeply in love. She immediately
forms a plan to induce this gentleman,
whose name is Camillo, to visit her, without either
knowing who she is or whither he is conducted. The
whole intrigue is managed by Leonarda’s coachman
Urbano, who is at the same time the <i>gracioso</i>, or
buffoon of the piece.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> While Urbano is gone out in
quest of Camillo, the three suitors, without any previous
arrangement with each other, arrive disguised as
dealers in books and copper-plate prints. They obtain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
an interview with Leonarda, and make avowals of their
passion; but she receives them very unfavourably, and
they are all obliged to make a rapid retreat to avoid
being roughly handled by the servants. This scene is
highly amusing. In the second act Camillo appears,
and after long hesitation, he consents to engage in the
romantic adventure. Urbano dresses him in a doctor’s
cloak, and drawing the hood (<i>capirote</i>) over his eyes,
he conducts him blindfold, with comic effect, through a
variety of windings, to the house of Leonarda. The
lady receives him in the dark. Lights are afterwards
brought in, but Leonarda remains masked. A sumptuous
collation is prepared, of which the young gentleman’s
doubt and embarrassment will not permit him to taste
a morsel. He compares himself to Alexander, when
he took the suspected goblet from the hand of his
physician.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> A tender dialogue ensues, after which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
hood is again drawn over the eyes of Camillo, and he is
conducted from Leonarda’s house. In this manner the
intrigue proceeds; but between many of the scenes,
whole days, and even weeks are supposed to intervene.
Leonarda and her lover become more and more intimate,
though he neither knows who she is, nor where she
resides. All his endeavours to discover these secrets
are unavailing; and at length he begins to suspect that
his unknown mistress is an old cousin of Leonarda. In
the mean time the three rejected suitors, who still mix
in the plot, become jealous of the coachman Urbano;
and one spirited scene succeeds another until an affray
occurs in which an honourable suitor of Leonarda is
wounded. This accident produces the denouement.
Camillo recognizes in his unknown mistress the beautiful
widow with whom he was previously acquainted,
and whose hand he joyfully accepts. Thus the piece
is a comedy from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Lope de Vega’s spiritual comedies, afford a picture of
the religious notions of the Spaniards in the age in which
he lived, not less faithfully pourtrayed than that by which
his dramas of intrigue represent the manners of Spanish
society. Pure piety, according to catholic ideas, wildly
blended with the most contradictory chimeras, and
these chimeras again ennobled by the boldest flights of
imagination, form altogether a monstrous and extravagant
patch-work; but this heterogeneous variety is,
nevertheless, united by the ramifications of a poetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
spirit, into a whole, to which no European imagination
could now be expected to produce a resemblance. But
Lope de Vega seems not to have come to a positive
determination respecting what ought to have been the
true spirit of these dramatic pictures of religious faith.
The mixture of poetic and unpoetic elements is very
unequal in his different spiritual comedies. His Lives
of the Saints possess far more dramatic spirit than his
Autos Sacramentales; while on the other hand, allegory
imparts a higher dignity to the religious mysticism of
the latter. Both, however, have in common a kind
of operatic style, combined with the display of theatrical
machinery and decoration, calculated to captivate the
senses. Of all the dramatic works of Lope de Vega, the
Lives of the Saints are in every respect the most irregular.
Allegorical characters, buffoons, saints, peasants, students,
kings, God, the infant Jesus, the devil, and all
the most heterogeneous beings that the wildest imagination
could bring together, are introduced. Music
seems always to have been an indispensable accessary.
Lope de Vega’s spiritual comedy, entitled the Life of
Saint Nicolas de Tolentino,<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> commences with a conversation
maintained by a party of students, who
make a display of their wit and scholastic learning.
Among them is the future saint, whose piety shines
with the brighter lustre when contrasted with the disorderly
gaiety of those by whom he is surrounded.
The devil disguised by a mask joins the party. A
skeleton appears in the air; the sky opens, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
Almighty is discovered sitting in judgment attended
by Justice and Mercy, who alternately influence his
decisions. Next succeeds a love intrigue between a
lady named Rosalia, and a gentleman named Feniso.
The future saint then re-enters attired in canonicals,
and delivers a sermon in redondillas. The parents
of the saint congratulate themselves on possessing
such a son; and this scene forms the conclusion of
the first act. At the opening of the second a party
of soldiers are discovered; the saint enters accompanied
by several monks, and offers up a prayer in
the form of a sonnet. Brother Peregrino relates the
romantic history of his conversion. Subtle theological
fooleries ensue, and numerous anecdotes of the lives of
the saints are related. St. Nicolas prays again through
the medium of a sonnet. He then rises in the air,
either by the power of faith, or the help of the theatrical
machinery; and the Holy Virgin and St. Augustin
descend from heaven to meet him.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> In the third act
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
the scene is transferred to Rome, where two cardinals
exhibit the holy sere cloth to the people by torch light.
Music performed on clarionets adds to the solemnity
of this ceremony, during which pious discourses are
delivered. St. Nicolas is next discovered embroidering
the habit of his order; and the pious observations which
he makes, while engaged in this occupation, are accompanied
by the chaunting of invisible angels. The music
attracts the devil, who endeavours to tempt St. Nicolas.
The next scene exhibits souls in the torments of purgatory.
The devil again appears attended by a retinue
of lions, serpents, and other hideous animals; but in a
scene, which is intended for burlesque, (<i>graciosamente</i>)
a monk armed with a great broom drives off the devil
and his suite.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> At the conclusion of the piece the saint
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
whose beatification is now complete, descends from
heaven in a garment bespangled with stars. As soon
as he touches the earth, the souls of his father and
mother are released from purgatory and rise through
a rock; the saint then returns hand-in-hand with his
parents to heaven, music playing as they ascend.</p>

<p>The <i>Autos Sacramentales</i> of Lope de Vega must
have been far less attractive than his Lives of the Saints.
Compared with the latter, their construction appears
very simple, and they are executed in a style of theological
refinement which could not have been perfectly
intelligible to the multitude. But the allegorical characters,
which are the most prominent in these pieces,
produce an imposing effect. The dramas themselves
are in general short. In one which represents the fall,
Man disputes with Sin and the Devil, and Earth and
Time take part in the dialogue. Next are discovered
Justice and Mercy seated beneath a canopy, and at a
table furnished with writing materials. Man is interrogated
before this tribunal. The Prince of heaven, or
Saviour, enters. Reflection, or Care, (<i>Cuidado</i>) kneels
and delivers a letter to him. The Saviour, who takes
his station behind a grating, makes Man undergo
another judicial examination, and pardons him.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
the devil re-appears and protests against the pardon.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a>
Man has next to contend with Vanity and Folly, who
are introduced as allegorical characters. Christ again
appears with the crown of thorns. In conclusion, the
heavens open and Christ ascends to his celestial throne,
with the usual accompaniment of music. Direct allusions
to the sacrament of the altar were seldom necessary
in the Autos, as the whole tendency of the allegorical
action was directed to that object.</p>

<p>Lope de Vega’s <i>Loas</i>, and more particularly his
<i>Entremeses</i> and <i>Saynetes</i>, seem to have been intended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
to indemnify the audience for the theological allegory
of the sacramental dramas; for it is only in connection
with the Autos that these preludes and interludes
are to be found. The Loas are not always comic,
and are sometimes only spirited monologues. The
interludes, or Entremeses and Saynetes, may also be
called preludes, for though they were performed after
the Loa, which was properly the prologue, yet they
preceded the Auto: these interludes are burlesque
from beginning to end, and form a preparation for the
devotion of the Auto, quite in the Spanish taste.
Farces of this kind, pourtraying the incidents of common
life, never destitute of genuine comic spirit, and
written for the most part in verse, soon became indispensable
to the Spaniards, and even to this day are
never omitted in their dramatic performances. The
interludes of Lope de Vega and Cervantes seem to
have been the models of all that succeeded them.</p>

<p>The dramatic genius of Lope de Vega has rendered
him immortal. In the seventeenth century his plays were
universally read and performed throughout Spain. In
general they were first published singly, and for the most
part with the bookseller’s epithet&mdash;<i>Comedia Famosa</i>,
(the Celebrated Comedy), which subsequently became a
universal device, affixed to all comedies printed in Spain.
In this manner Lope de Vega’s most popular comedies
were, partly during the life of the author, and partly
after his death, collected in five-and-twenty volumes;<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
exclusively of the Autos, preludes, and interludes, which
afterwards formed a separate publication.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> Among
Lope’s scattered dramas which have been printed at a
later period, are some which are expressly denominated
tragedies.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></p>

<p id="BRIEF_NOTICE_OF_HIS_OTHER_POETIC_WORKS">The other poetic works of this prolific writer, must
be very briefly noticed; for to give any thing like a
particular account of them would require the space of
a considerable volume.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> In epic poetry he maintained
an unsuccessful contest with Tasso. His <i>Jerusalem Conquistada</i>,<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a>
consists indeed of twenty cantos in octaves,
and contains some beautiful passages, but it will in no
respect bear a comparison with the Italian poem. Lope
de Vega also augmented the number of the continuers
of Ariosto’s Orlando, by the publication of <i>La Hermosura
de Angelica</i>,<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> (the Beauty of Angelica), which is
also a narrative poem in twenty cantos, though shorter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
than those of the Jerusalem. His other attempts at
epic composition are&mdash;<i>La Corona Tragica</i>,<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> (the Tragic
Crown), or the history of the unfortunate Mary Stuart,
Queen of Scotland; and the <i>Circe</i> and <i>Dragontea</i>.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a>
The <i>Corona Tragica</i> is full of furious invective against
the protestants and against Queen Elizabeth in particular.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a>
The hero of the <i>Dragontea</i> is Admiral Drake,
who is introduced in this poem as the tool of Satan, in
order that he may finally serve as an example of poetic
justice. To compete with Sanazzar, Lope wrote a second
Arcadia,<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> in the style of the Italian. He likewise wrote
several poems, which may be called eclogues in the proper
sense of the term. His <i>Arte Nueva de Hazer Comedias</i>,
(New Art of Writing Comedies), is a humorous satire on
his opponents under the appearance of ridiculing himself.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a>
He anonymously supplied the <i>Romancero General</i>
with thirty-six romances.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> His spiritual poems are to be
found in great profusion; and the number of his sonnets,
some of which possess first-rate merit, is considerable.
His <i>Laurel de Apolo</i>, a Eulogy on various Spanish
Poets, which has been frequently quoted, is but an
indifferent production.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> His epistles are sufficiently
numerous. Among his miscellaneous poems, those of
the comic kind have most originality, as for example:
<i>La Gatomachia</i>, (the Battle of Cats),<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> and the whole
collection of miscellaneous poems which he published
under the assumed name of the Licentiate Tomè de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
Burguillos.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> Among his most celebrated prose works,
are <i>El Peregrino en su Patria</i>, (the Stranger in his own
Country), a tolerably long novel.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> <i>Dorothea</i>, a dramatic
story, or as it is called, <i>Accion en Prosa</i>;<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> and a Collection
of Novels.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></p>

<h3 id="THE_BROTHERS_LEONARDO_DE_ARGENSOLA">THE BROTHERS LEONARDO DE ARGENSOLA.</h3>

<p>Among the poets who flourished during the period
now under consideration, the place next in rank to
Cervantes and Lope de Vega, must be assigned to two
brothers, whom their countrymen have surnamed the
Horaces of Spain. Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola
born in 1565, and Bartholemè Leonardo de Argensola,
born in 1566, belonged to a respectable family, of Italian
origin, but settled in Arragon. Lupercio, who pursued
his academic studies in Saragossa, had the satisfaction
to witness the successful performance of three tragedies,
which he wrote in the twentieth year of his age, and
which are honourably mentioned by Cervantes in his
Don Quixote. His taste, however, led him to cultivate
another style of poetry, in which he could imitate
Horace, of whom he was an enthusiastic admirer. His
family connection facilitated his introduction to persons
of rank; and he became secretary to the Empress Maria
of Austria, who at that time resided in Spain. He was
soon after appointed chamberlain to the Archduke
Albert of Austria. King Philip III. nominated him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
one of the chroniclers or historiographers of Arragon,
and directed him to continue the annals of Zurita; and
the states of Arragon, which already possessed their
own particular chronicler, seized some plausible excuse
for dismissing him, in order that Lupercio Leonardo de
Argensola might also be appointed historiographer for
them. He then determined to devote himself exclusively
to the duties of his office; but he was induced
to go to Italy in company with the Count de Lemos,
the celebrated patron of Cervantes, who was at that
time viceroy of Naples. Lupercio was appointed secretary
of state and of war for Naples; but amidst the
varied and laborious duties attached to such a situation,
he actively pursued his poetic studies, and did not even
discontinue his Arragonese annals. He was the principal
founder of the academy at Naples. While prosecuting
this honourable career he died in 1613, in the
fortieth year of his age. Like Virgil, when he felt the
approach of death, he burnt a considerable portion of
his poems.</p>

<p>Bartholemè, the younger Leonardo de Argensola,
entered the ecclesiastical state. During the first half
of his life, his success in the world was inseparably
connected with the fortunes of his brother. He was
chaplain to the Empress Maria of Austria, then a
canon in Saragossa; and afterwards proceeded to Naples
in company with his brother and the Count de Lemos.
He quitted Italy on the death of his brother, and was
appointed to complete the continuation of the annals of
Arragon which Lupercio had left in an imperfect state;
a task which he executed in a way that gave universal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
satisfaction. While the Count de Lemos was president
of the council of the Indies, Bartholemè Leonardo de
Argensola wrote a history of the conquest of the Molucca
islands. He was indefatigable in the pursuit of
his historical and poetic studies; and after passing a
tranquil and honourable life, he died at Saragossa in
1631, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p>The poetry of these two brothers, who, in a critical
point of view, may both be regarded as one individual,
is not characterized by originality, or by depth of genius,
in the extended sense of the word. It is, however,
remarkable for a fine poetic feeling distinct from
enthusiasm, a vigorous and aspiring spirit, a happy
talent for description, poignant wit, classic dignity
of style, and above all, singular correctness of taste.
Both pursued the same course with equal ardour and
adroitness; but Bartholemè had the better opportunity
of cultivating his talent, because he lived longest.
Next to Luis de Leon, they are the most correct of all
Spanish poets.</p>

<p id="TRAGEDIES_BY_THE_ELDER_ARGENSOLA">The tragedies with which Lupercio commenced his
poetic career, considered as youthful essays, are worthy
to be remembered, though they do not merit the unbounded
praise which Cervantes bestowed on them in
a fit of panegyrical enthusiasm. It appears that they
did not long maintain their place on the stage. Two of
the three mentioned by Cervantes were, at no very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
remote period, rescued from oblivion, and the third still
remains undiscovered.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> The two which have been recovered,
and which are entitled, the one <i>Isabella</i>, and
the other <i>Alexandra</i>, afford excellent specimens of language
and versification. The Alexandra contains scenes,
particularly in the second and third acts, which the
greatest tragic writer might advantageously adopt and
interweave into a better constructed piece.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> The Isabella
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
is a trivial web of love intrigues, and terminates
in a manner sufficiently awful; but the piece is totally
destitute of tragic dignity, notwithstanding that it exhibits
the languishing and raging of two Moorish kings,
with all the pomp of oriental accessaries. Alexandra
presents more numerous and correct traits of resemblance
to the ancient drama; and yet towards the close
the action becomes most extravagant, and is marked by
all the tumult of a modern theatrical spectacle.</p>

<p>But the poetic fame of Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola,
does not rest on his tragedies. His lyric poems,
epistles, and satires in the manner of Horace, have
transmitted his name, without the aid of any recommendation
to posterity. Lupercio formed his style
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
after that of Horace, with no less assiduity than Luis
de Leon; but he did not possess the soft enthusiasm
of that pious poet, who in the religious spirit of his
poetry is so totally unlike Horace. An understanding
at once solid and ingenious, subject to no extravagant
illusion, yet full of true poetic feeling, and an imagination
more plastic than creative, impart a more perfect
horatian colouring to the odes, as well as to the canciones
and sonnets of Lupercio. He closely imitated
Horace in his didactic satires, a style of composition in
which no Spanish poet had preceded him. But he
never succeeded in attaining the bold combination of
ideas which characterizes the ode style of Horace; and
his conceptions have therefore seldom any thing like
the horatian energy. On the other hand, all his poems
express no less precision of language, than the models
after which he formed his style. His odes, in particular,
are characterized by a picturesque tone of expression,
which he seems to have imbibed from Virgil
rather than from Horace.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> The extravagant metaphors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
by which some of Herrera’s odes are deformed, were
uniformly avoided by Lupercio. His best sonnets are
those of a sententious cast, which have some moral
idea for their subject.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> He was likewise successful in
the composition of popular songs in redondillas. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
epistles in tercets present, in their kind, about the same
degree of resemblance to the epistles of Horace, as is
observable between his odes and those of his classic
model. The ideas are expressed in a clear, precise,
and pleasing style; and these compositions are not destitute
of poetic and didactic interest. Still, however,
the vigour of Horace is wanting.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> Lupercio did not
enter, with sufficient decision, into the true spirit of
horatian satire. He consigned to his brother the task
of cultivating that class of composition, in which poetry
is scarcely distinguishable from spirited prose. Among
his writings, which escaped the flames, there is only one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
piece of satirical raillery, in the form of an epistle to a
coquette.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<p id="EPISTLES_ODES">The poetic works of Bartholemè, the younger
Leonardo de Argensola, which have been preserved,
are twice as numerous as those of Lupercio. The style
of the two brothers is so similar, that in some cases
it is difficult, and in others totally impossible to distinguish
the one from the other. This extraordinary
conformity of character, talent and taste, appears at
first sight no less singular a phenomenon than the inexhaustible
fertility of Lope de Vega. But it will
be recollected, that these brothers, who were nearly of
an age, and almost inseparable companions, and who
were constantly occupied in the study and imitation of
the same models, could not fail, by the cultivation
of similar, and in neither original talents, closely to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
approximate. Still, however, traces of difference are discoverable
in their works. Bartholemè, by his numerous
epistles and satires, performed greater services to Spanish
poetry than his brother Lupercio. He was the first Spanish
writer who introduced concentrated satire in sonnets,
which he probably did after he became acquainted with
the Italian poems of that class, but he has imitated
them with the spirit of Horace, and has avoided every
thing like Italian flippancy. His spiritual canciones,
which are not equalled by any in the poetic works of
Lupercio, are among the best in the style to which they
belong. His most esteemed works bear the impress
of a more cultivated talent than is discernible in the
writings of his brother. His longer and properly didactic
satires are characterized by more causticity than
gaiety in the ridicule of general and particular follies.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a>
But the enthusiasm of the moralist never leads him into
declamation in the manner of Juvenal; and these satires
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
are equally replete with traits of mild philanthropy
and sound judgment. His epistles on human felicity
and human weakness have nearly the same character,
but they are for the most part serious and devoid of
irony.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> His satirical sonnets present unequal degrees
of merit; but in the best, the pupil of Horace is more
obviously recognisable.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> That Bartholemè should have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
succeeded in spiritual canciones, may at first sight be
deemed a psychological enigma. But it was precisely
his critical and reflective turn of mind which proved
most essentially serviceable in guiding him through the
gloomy regions of catholic mysticism. Being an enthusiastic
catholic, he wanted no extraordinary inspiration
to furnish him with religious ideas; and the faculties
of a language eminently picturesque, supplied him with
new views and images which he alternately developed
in majestic descriptions,<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> and pleasing comparisons.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<p>The praises lavished on the Argensolas by all
parties, would afford sufficient ground for the conjecture
that their poetic works had produced some
influence on their contemporaries. But that influence
is chiefly obvious from the poetic style of the men of
talent with whom they lived on terms of intimacy, of
one of whom, named Alonzo Esquerro, there is extant
a short but excellent epistle, published along with the
answer of Bartholemè de Argensola.</p>

<p>The historical works of the younger Argensola, are
also deserving of honourable mention in an account of
the polite literature of Spain. Few narratives of Indian
affairs are written with so much judgment and elegance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
as his History of the Conquest of the Molucca Islands;<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a>
and his continuation of the Annals of Zurita,<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> exceeds
in rhetorical merit the work of the original historiographer.
The circumstances connected with the accession
of Charles V. and the Castilian rebellion, subjects
to which no Spanish writer had previously ventured to
allude, are related by Argensola with no less freedom
and fidelity than other events; though of course without
his attempting to urge any apology for the rebels. In
the reign of Philip III. but little danger was to be
apprehended from such freedom; and when, in the year
1621, Philip IV. ascended the throne in the seventeenth
year of his age, Argensola did not hesitate to dedicate
his Arragonian Annals to the Duke of Olivarez, who in
the name of the young king was invested with unlimited
sovereign authority. The Duke of Olivarez on receiving
this dedication little imagined that the recollection of the
ancient privileges of the Arragonian states, which had
been solemnly ratified by Charles V. and which were so
much expatiated on in these annals, would, at no very
remote period, be the means of rousing the people of
Arragon to take up arms in defence of their constitution,
on which the duke wished to encroach, in order to
recruit the exhausted strength of Castile.

<h3 class="hang" id="CONTINUATION_OF_THE_HISTORY_OF_SPANISH_POETRY">CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF SPANISH POETRY
AND ELOQUENCE DURING THE AGE OF
CERVANTES AND LOPE DE VEGA.</h3>

<p>A very accurate idea of the general spirit of elegant
literature in Spain, during the age of Cervantes
and Lope de Vega, will be obtained, if, to an examination
of the works of those eminent men and the two
Argensolas, be added a recollection of the labours of
their immediate predecessors; for the other Spanish
poets of this period followed in the beaten path as far
as they were able to go, and if any one ventured on a
new course he only wandered into insipidity. These
authors, though deficient in originality, are not without
merit; but so great is their number, that it would be
impossible to find room for even a very brief notice of
all their works in a general history of literature. There
was at this time a sort of poetical ferment in Spain,
which can only be compared with that which prevailed
in Italy during the sixteenth century. The blending
of the Italian style with the old Spanish, had excited a
new enthusiasm throughout the whole nation; and in
proportion as the Spaniards were excluded from philosophic
thinking, their passion for works of fancy was
augmented. Under these circumstances eloquence could
only follow in the train of poetry.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span></p>

<h3 id="FRESH_FAILURES_IN_EPIC_POETRY">FRESH FAILURES IN EPIC POETRY&mdash;ERCILLA’S
ARAUCANA.</h3>

<p>Success in epic poetry was still denied to the Spanish
muse. The confounding of epic poetry with relations
of actual events embellished with poetic language, seems
to have perverted the talent for true epopee. The
Spanish poets who attempted this style, studied after
the deceitful model of Lucan, and, according to an old
critical phrase, endeavoured to be more <i>Lucanists</i> than
Lucan himself. The imagination which possessed unbounded
dominion over the stage, seems to have obtained
in narrative poetry only the scanty privilege of
inventing a few ornaments.</p>

<p>Among the unsuccessful attempts at epopee, particular
distinction is due to the <i>Araucana</i> of the heroic
and amiable Alonzo de Ercilla y Zuñiga, a poem which
has the accidental advantage of being better known on
this side of the Pyrenees than many other Spanish
works of far superior merit. Ercilla has recorded the
most remarkable events of his own biography in the
<i>Araucana</i>, and the remainder of the poem also reflects
an interest on the author. He was born at Madrid in
1540, or according to some in 1533, and became page
to the prince of Asturias, Don Philip, with whom he
travelled to Italy, the Netherlands, and England. At
the age of twenty-two, he embarked as an officer for
America, along with a newly appointed viceroy of Peru.
He distinguished himself in the war against the Araucans,
the bravest of the South American tribes. In
the midst of his exploits, he conceived with a youthful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
ambition the plan of writing a narrative of the conquest
of Arauco in an epic form, but with the strictest regard
to historical truth. He executed his project in spite of
the dangers which surrounded him, and the fatigues he
had to undergo. In a wilderness inhabited by savages,
in the midst of enemies, and under no other cover than
that of heaven, he composed at night the verses which
were to be the memorials of the events of the day. In
prosecution of his purpose, he was obliged to use scraps
of waste paper, which often could not contain more than
six lines, or to make pieces of leather supply the total
want of paper. In this way he completed the first part
of his poem, consisting of fifteen cantos. Before he was
thirty years of age he returned to Spain, full of hope,
both as a soldier and a poet; but the gloomy Philip, to
whom he enthusiastically dedicated the <i>Araucana</i>, took
little notice of him, and less of his work. Ercilla deeply
felt this neglect; but nothing could damp his romantic
attachment to his cold-hearted sovereign, whom he still
persisted in celebrating in the sequel of his poem. He received
no mark of favour except from the Emperor Maximilian
II. who appointed him one of his chamberlains.
Dissatisfied with his fate, Ercilla travelled from place to
place; but his journies did not prevent him from proceeding
with his poem until he completed it by the
addition of a third part. When he died is not known,
but it was after he had attained his fiftieth year.</p>

<p>The <i>Araucana</i>, so called from the country Arauco,
is really no poem. It is, however, impossible to read
the work without becoming attached to the author, and
being delighted by his talent for lively description, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
for painting situations, his possession of which no just
critic can call in question. But notwithstanding that
talent, Ercilla is merely a versifying historian, capable of
clothing his subject in a poetic garb, but not of elevating
it to the sphere of true poetry. His diction is natural
and correct; and to this the <i>Araucana</i> is in a great measure
indebted for its celebrity. Its descriptive beauties,
and some scenes in the style of romantic love, certainly
make the composition approximate to poetry; but the
heroic spirit which pervades the whole work, is by no
means a poetic spirit. The principal events follow each
other in chronological order. The combats are described
in succession, as they actually arose, without any regard
to poetic interest. Ercilla, indeed, prided himself on this
historical precision, and he challenged any of his countrymen
who were acquainted with the war in Arauco,
to detect a single inaccuracy in his narrative. The
historical succession of events imparts, however, a sort
of epic unity to the work. The Spaniards in Arauco
are surrounded by dangers, which gradually augment
until they reach a crisis; when a reinforcement arrives
from Peru, and the Spaniards experience a favourable
change of fortune. The capture of Caupolican, the
Araucan commander, who is put to death in a way repugnant
to humanity, closes the narrative, though it
does not terminate the war; but the barbarous and
unjust execution of this brave chief being decreed by
a Spanish council of war, is not censured by Ercilla.
From the manner in which the poem concludes, it must
be regarded as incomplete, considered as an historical
narrative. Even the moral interest of the events
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
operates in a way contrary to the intention of the
author; for the feelings of the unprejudiced reader are,
from the commencement excited in favour of the brave
savages, who half-naked, and destitute of fire arms,
contend for their natural freedom against enemies so
superior in the art of war. The style of historical
truth in which the principal events are narrated, forms
a disagreeable contrast with the fiction in the details,
which is intended to diffuse a poetic character over the
whole work; for Ercilla at length found it necessary to
depart from his plan in order to escape from the monotony
into which he had fallen. In the first fifteen
cantos the poetic colouring is merely confined to the
descriptions; but in the two following parts,<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> the author
has interwoven a number of fabulous accessaries. He
has introduced, for example, a poetic account of the
magician Fiton’s wonderful skill and garden of paradise,<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a>
and also the story of the fair savage Glaura,
who recounts the incidents of her life in the style of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
Spanish romance.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> Ercilla likewise relates the death
of Dido after Virgil, and in honour of his king he gives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
a detailed account of the battle of Lepanto. In addition
to the descriptions, some of the speeches, particularly
that delivered by the Cacique Colocolo in the
second canto,<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> may be referred to as the best parts of
this unpoetic poem.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the passion for epic poetry, which took
possession of so many Spanish writers in the age of
Cervantes and Lope de Vega, gave birth to a torrent of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
heroic poems. To the Caroliads, which have already
been noticed, there succeeded <i>La Restauracion de
España</i>, (the Restoration of Spain), by Christoval de
Mesa; <i>Las Navas de Tolosa</i>, (the Plains of Toulouse),
by the same author; <i>La Numantina</i>, by Francisco de
Mesquera; <i>La Invencion de la Cruz</i>, (the Invention
of the Cross), by Lopez Zarate; <i>Maltea</i>, by Hyppolyto
Sanz; <i>El Leon de España</i>, (the Spanish Lion), by
Pedro de Vezilla; <i>Saguntina</i>, by Lorenzo de Zamora;
<i>Mexicana</i>, by Gabriel Laso de Vega; <i>Austriada</i>, by Rufo
Guttieraz; &amp;c. None but men who make this branch of
literature their particular study, now think of perusing
these and similar patriotic effusions, which were at the
period of their publication regarded as epic poems,<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> but
which only serve to prove, with the greater certainty, that
Spain is incapable of producing a Homer. A genuine
subject for epopee was scarcely to be found in the national
history of Spain, even during the ages of chivalry; and
modern history was not then more susceptible than
now of receiving a truly epic form.</p>

<h3 id="LYRIC_AND_BUCOLIC_POETS">LYRIC AND BUCOLIC POETS OF THE CLASSIC
SCHOOL OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

<p>Lyric and bucolic poetry and also elegant satire,
after the two Argensolas had given the tone to that
species of composition, continued to be cultivated by
various pupils of the classic school of the sixteenth
century. This school which was then on the decline
in Italy, still maintained its ground in Spain, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
preserved its reputation in spite of the opposition made
by the different parties who contended for their respective
styles, particularly by that of Lope de Vega, and by
one of a still more dangerous kind, which will soon be
more distinctly noticed. The disciples of this classic
school, together with those writers who, since the time
of Boscan and Garcilaso de la Vega, had formed their
style on the model of the ancients and the most
esteemed poets of Italy, may be called the Spanish
<i>Cinquecentisti</i>, in a favourable sense of the term, though
some of them wrote in the seventeenth century. The
most distinguished among them really flourished in the
sixteenth century; and the rest, whose number is incalculable,
possessed, at least, the merit of endeavouring,
like the Italian <i>Cinquecentisti</i>, to express sensible ideas
in correct language.</p>

<p id="VICENTE_ESPINEL">To this classic school belongs Vicente Espinel, an
ecclesiastic of the province of Granada. He was likewise
celebrated as a musician, and he perfected the
Spanish guitar by the addition of the fifth string. He
died in poverty, in the ninetieth year of his age, at
Madrid in 1634. His canciones, idyls, and elegies, though
destitute of originality, are distinguished by a spirited
and inartificial character, and they abound in beautiful
images and descriptions. Espinel’s poetic style is
extremely melodious. In his idyls he has very successfully
imitated the pleasing syllabic measure which
Gil Polo introduced into Spanish literature under the
name of <i>Rimas Provenzales</i>;<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> and he was one of those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
writers who most contributed to bestow a metrical polish
on the redondilla stanzas of ten lines, (<i>decimas</i>). He
translated Horace’s Art of Poetry, in iambic blank
verse, and several of Horace’s Odes after the manner
of Luis de Leon. Some of this author’s prose works
will hereafter be noticed.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a></p>

<p id="CHRISTOVAL_DE_MESA">Christoval de Mesa, an ecclesiastic of Estremadura,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
was contemporary with Tarquato Tasso, with whom
he maintained the most friendly intercourse. He made,
however, very little improvement in epic art through
his intimacy with that celebrated man. Of three
compositions, which Christoval de Mesa intended for
epic poems, not one has been preserved from oblivion.
His tragedy of Pompey is likewise forgotten. He was
nevertheless a good translator; and his translations of
the Æneid and the Iliad are esteemed even at the
present day. He also published a Spanish version of
Virgil’s Georgics.</p>

<p id="JUAN_DE_MORALES">Juan de Morales obtained a similar reputation
through his translation of Horace’s Odes and Virgil’s
Georgics. The particulars of his life are not known.
He wrote some good sonnets.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> This writer must not
be confounded with his namesake, Ambrosio de Morales,
the historian.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span></p>

<p id="AGUSTIN_DE_TEXADA">Agustin de Texada, or Tejada, who was born in the
year 1635, is distinguished as a writer of spiritual odes
and canciones. His poems in this class vie with those
of the younger Argensola in poetic dignity of composition
and genuine lyric diction.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> He has, however,
committed the error of introducing mythological images
in his christian poetry. But in this respect he merely
conformed with the bad taste of his age, which in Spain
and Portugal favoured the most absurd misapplication
of the Greek mythology; for, to humour the prejudices
of the church, it was necessary that the heathen deities
should appear only as allegorical characters in catholic
poetry.</p>

<p>Andres Rey de Artieda, a brave Arragonian officer,
was a very learned scholar and a particular friend of
the Argensolas. Among other works, he wrote poetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
epistles which are full of good sense and natural feeling.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a>
His sonnets are remarkable for their novel and poignant
style.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span></p>

<p>Gregorio Morillo imitated Juvenal in his didactic
satires, and vented his spleen in well-turned verses.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></p>

<p>Luis Barahona de Soto is, in preference to many of
his contemporaries, entitled to an honourable place among
Spanish poets. He was born in the province of Granada,
and was a physician by profession. His eclogues resemble
those of Garcilaso de la Vega; and his canciones abound
in romantic grace.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> His satires, which were lately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
republished, have the spirit of Juvenal, but want the
delicacy of Horace; they are, however, written in a
clear and energetic style. This writer moreover gained
celebrity by a continuation of the Orlando Furioso,
which was highly esteemed by Cervantes, and which
is entitled, <i>Las Lagrimas de Angelica</i>, (the Tears of
Angelica).<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></p>

<p>Pedro Soto de Rojas, who was a particular favourite
of Lope de Vega, endeavoured to introduce the academic
systems of Italy, which had never been successfully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
imitated in Spain. A literary society established at
Madrid, after the Italian fashion, received the ludicrous
title of <i>Academia Selvaje</i>, (Academy of Savages;) and
in this society Soto de Rojas was distinguished by the
surname of <i>l’Ardiente</i>. His eclogues have the usual
character of Spanish poems of that class, clothed in
elegant and harmonious language.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></p>

<p>Luis Martin, or Martinez de la Plaza, an ecclesiastic
of Granada, a province fertile in literary talent, was
particularly celebrated for the grace of his madrigals,
and other small poems of a similar kind.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span></p>

<p>Balthazar del Alcazar, who appears to have been a
native of Andalusia, sought to distinguish himself as a
writer of epigrammatic madrigals. In his comic madrigals,<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a>
he was, however, less successful than in those of
gallantry.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> He also appears to have been one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
first Spanish poets who wrote odes in sapphic feet, in
so far as the Spanish language would permit the employment
of that measure.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></p>

<p>Gonzalo de Argote y Molina, one of those brave
men, who, in the reign of Philip II. combated with
enthusiasm for the honour of their country and their
king, but whose valour remained unrequited, was more
distinguished as an historian than as a poet. To his
literary patriotism the Spaniards were indebted for
the publication of the Infante Don Manuel’s <i>Conde
Lucanor</i>.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> His poems are, however, worthy of honourable
notice. An ardent love of country is the
soul of his canciones and other lyric compositions.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span></p>

<p>Francisco de Figueroa spent a portion of his life in
Italy, in the twofold capacity of an officer and a statesman.
During his residence among the Italians, he enjoyed
a degree of public esteem which was extended
to few of his countrymen. He wrote poems in Italian
as well as in Spanish. Among his friends and admirers
he was called the <i>divine</i>, and he was ranked among
the most eminent Petrarchists of his age. His amatory
sonnets are written in a pleasing and natural style, and
abound in the softest touches of romantic melancholy.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
The admirers of Francisco de Figueroa likewise conferred
on him the surname of the Spanish Pindar; but
that was a mere whim.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a></p>

<p>Christoval Suarez de Figueroa, who was an imitator
of Montemayor, wrote a pastoral romance, entitled
<i>Amarillis</i>, which was very generally read at the time
of its publication. He also made a translation of Guarini’s
Pastor Fido, and cultivated with some degree of
success the Italian lyric forms of pastoral romance.
Some of the poems of the latter class contained in the
<i>Romancero General</i>, appear to be written by this
author. His <i>Endechas</i>, or Elegiac Songs in the popular
style, though not particularly rich in ideas, are nevertheless
pleasing with respect to language and versification.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span></p>

<p>Another poet of this name, Bartholomè Cayrasco
de Figueroa, is the author of a long series of spiritual
canciones and tales called <i>cantos</i>, which were much
esteemed on account of the edification attributed to
their contents. In these poems he explains the mysticism
of the christian religion, according to the catholic
dogmas and the scholastic ideas of christian virtue, in
a manner more pedantic than poetic; but yet in pure
and elegant language. He was likewise one of the
Spanish imitators of the Italian verse with dactyllic
terminations, called <i>versos esdrujolos</i>, from the Italian
<i>versi sdruccioli</i>.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span></p>

<p>Juan de Arguijo, a native of Seville, seems to have
enjoyed high reputation among the poets of his time.
Lope de Vega formally dedicated several of his works
to him. Some well written sonnets and other small
poems are the only productions of this author now
extant.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></p>

<p>Pedro Espinosa, an ecclesiastic who possessed some
poetic talent, and who wrote on various subjects, compiled
a lyric anthology of the works of the above and
other Spanish poets, who adhered more or less rigidly to
the principles of the old school, but whose fancy sometimes
roamed unrestrained with Lope de Vega, or
sometimes degenerated into affectation with Gongora.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span></p>

<h3 id="RISE_OF_A_NEW">RISE OF A NEW IRREGULAR AND FANTASTICAL
STYLE IN SPANISH POETRY.</h3>

<p>It is impossible to draw a rigid line of separation
between the disciples of the classic school, and the partizans
of lyric irregularity, who indulged in no less
freedom than Lope de Vega, while at the same time
they endeavoured to exceed him in forced conceits.
Even the disciples of the classic school are not totally
exempt from extravagant ideas and unnatural metaphors;
and they occasionally pour forth a torrent of
words, which though sometimes big with brilliant
ideas, more frequently wastes itself in mere froth and
foam. It cannot be doubted that the Italian school of
the Marinists exercised an influence on these Spanish
poets. But Marino, being a Neapolitan by birth, was
a Spanish subject, and educated among Spaniards.
It is therefore more natural to regard his style as originally
Spanish, than to trace to Italy the source of
those aberrations of fancy, which, in the age of Cervantes
and Lope de Vega, again found admirers in
Spain. Marino’s was the old Spanish national style,
with all its faults, divested of its ancient energy and
purity, polished after a new fashion, stripped of its
simplicity, tortured into the most absurd affectation of
refinement, and that affectation displayed in a boundless
prolixity.</p>

<p>One of the most zealous adherents of this party was
Manuel Faria y Sousa, a Portuguese by birth. Some
cause of discontent had induced him to quit his native
country and to fix his residence in Spain; and in composing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
both poetry and prose, he in general preferred
the Castilian to his vernacular tongue.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> It can scarcely
be supposed that he introduced this perverted taste from
Portugal; though his Portuguese poems exhibit no less
affectation of style than those which he composed in
Castilian, and in which a judicious direction of the
fancy is seldom observable. His ideas are, for the
most part, intolerably fantastic. One of his Castilian
songs, for example, is composed in honour of his mistress’s
eyes, “in whose beauty, (he says) love has inscribed
the poet’s fate, and which are as large as his
pain, and as black as his destiny, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> He displays
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
similar extravagance in most of his Castilian sonnets:
in one, for instance, he relates “how ten lucid arrows of
chrystal, were darted at him from the eyes of his Albania,
which produced a <i>rubious</i> effect on his pain,
though the cause was chrystaline,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> In this absurd
style he composed hundreds of sonnets. Faria y Sousa,
however, wrote several good works on history and statistics;<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a>
and it must be recollected that in his poetry he
merely followed the party which he most admired, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
which indeed had its precursors in Portugal as well as
in Spain.</p>

<p>This party which soon became powerful, imitated
the negligence of Lope de Vega. But Lope de Vega
was not a pedant; and when he failed in producing
real beauties, he did not coin false ones. His pretended
imitators, however, used the alloy of pedantry most
unsparingly, and thereby carried the affectation of ingenious
thoughts, in the style of the Italian Marinists,
to an incredible height.</p>

<h3 id="GONGORA_AND_HIS_ESTILO_CULTO">GONGORA AND HIS ESTILO CULTO&mdash;THE CULTORISTOS&mdash;THE
CONCEPTISTOS.</h3>

<p>Luis de Gongora de Argote was the founder and the
idol of the fantastical sect, which at this period led the
fashion in literature, and attempted to create a new
epoch in Spanish poetry by dint of exquisite cultivation
and refinement. Gongora was a man of shrewd and
powerful mind; but his natural faculties were perverted
by a systematic prosecution of absurd critical reveries.
Through life he had to maintain a constant struggle
with the frowns of fortune. He was born in Cordova,
in the year 1561; and after completing his studies in
his native city found himself without any provision for
the future. He took holy orders, and after eleven years
of solicitation at the court of Madrid, obtained a scanty
benefice. The dissatisfied turn of mind, occasioned by
his adverse fortune, contributed to develope that caustic
wit, for which he was particularly distinguished. He
wrote satirical sonnets, which for bitterness of spirit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
can scarcely be exceeded;<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> and he was still more successful
in romances and songs in the burlesque satirical
style. Works of this kind, did not, it is true, possess
the merit of novelty in Spanish literature; but Gongora’s
satirical poems are vastly superior to those of Castillejo.
It would be scarcely possible to preserve, in a translation,
the caustic spirit of Gongora’s romances and songs.
To give full effect to these compositions, the genuine
national spirit of the serious romances and canciones
must never be lost sight of. In Gongora’s satirical
works the language and versification are correct and
elegant, and the piquant simplicity of the whole
style would never lead to the supposition that the
ambition of marking an epoch in literature could
have betrayed the author into the most intolerable
affectation.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> He was less successful in seizing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
cordial tone of the old narrative romances. But his canciones
in the ancient Spanish style are in general masterly
compositions, full of true natural and poetic feeling.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span></p>

<p>It was doubtless in one of his moments of ill-humour
that Gongora conceived the idea of creating for serious
poetry a peculiar phraseology, which he called the <i>estilo
culto</i>, meaning thereby the highly cultivated or polished
style. In fulfilment of this object, he formed for
himself, with the most laborious assiduity, a style as
uncommon as affected, and opposed to all the ordinary
rules of the Spanish language, either in prose or verse.
He particularly endeavoured to introduce into his native
tongue the intricate constructions of the greek and
latin, though such an arrangement of words had never
before been attempted in Spanish composition. He
consequently found it necessary to invent a particular
system of punctuation, in order to render the sense of
his verses intelligible. Not satisfied with this patchwork
kind of phraseology he affected to attach an extraordinary
depth of meaning to each word, and to diffuse an air
of superior dignity over his whole style. In Gongora’s
poetry the most common words received a totally new
signification; and in order to impart perfection to his
<i>estilo culto</i>, he summoned all his mythological learning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
to his aid. Such was Gongora’s <i>New Art</i>. In this style
he wrote his <i>Soledades</i>, his <i>Polyphemus</i>, and several
other works. Even the choice of the title <i>Soledades</i>,
(Solitudes), was an instance of Gongora’s affectation; for
he did not intend to express by that term the signification
attached to a similar Portuguese word, (<i>Saudade</i>),
which is the title for a work relating to the thoughts
and aspirations of a recluse. Gongora wished by his
fantastic title to convey an idea of solitary forests,
because he had divided his poem into <i>sylvas</i>, (forests),
according to a particular meaning which the word bears
in latin. This work, like all Gongora’s productions in
the same style, is merely an insipid fiction, full of pompous
mythological images, described in a strain of the
most fantastic bombast.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> The Duke of Bejar, to
whom the work is inscribed, must, if he only read
the dedicatory lines, have imagined himself transported
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
to some foreign region, in which the Spanish language
was tortured without mercy.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> Gongora appears to
have been peculiarly anxious to develope the spirit of
his <i>New Art</i>, both at the commencement and the close
of his whimsical compositions.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span></p>

<p>Gongora’s innovations did not, however, tend to better
his fortune; for when he died in 1627, he held merely
the post of titular chaplain to the king. But his works
were universally read in Spain; and in proportion as
men of sound judgment emphatically protested against
the absurd innovations of the Gongorists, the more
vehemently did these assert their pretensions.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> Thus
Gongora in some measure attained his object. His
arduous exertions to establish his style did not, it is
true, promote him to a lucrative post; but they were
rewarded with the unlimited admiration of a numerous
party, composed of men of half-formed taste, who
found it easy in the crisis of the conflict between the
Spanish national style and the Italian, to raise themselves
into importance. Proud of their half cultivation,
they regarded every writer who did not admire and
imitate the style of their master, as a man of limited
talent, incapable of appreciating the beauties of their
<i>estilo culto</i>.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> But none of Gongora’s partizans possessed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
the talent of their leader, and their affectation became
on that account still more insupportable. They soon
separated into two similar yet distinct schools, one of
which represented the pedantry of its founder, while
the other, in order to render the art of versifying the
easier, even dispensed with that precision of style which
Gongora, in his wildest flights, still sought to preserve.
The disciples of the first school were proud to be the
commentators of their master; and in their voluminous
illustrations of Gongora’s unintelligible works, they did
not neglect to pour forth all the stores of their erudition.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a>
These were called the <i>Cultoristos</i>, a name which
was applied to them in derision. The second school
of the Gongorists more nearly resembled that of the
Marinists; and its disciples were distinguished by the
name of <i>Conceptistos</i>, in imitation of the Italian term
<i>Concettisti</i>, which was applied to the followers of Marino.
The <i>Conceptistos</i> revelled in the wildest regions of
fancy, without the least regard to propriety or precision,
and were only desirous of expressing preposterous and
extravagant ideas (<i>concetti</i>) in the unnatural language of
Gongora. Some individuals of this party were, however,
inclined to imitate the careless style of Lope de Vega.</p>

<p>Alonzo de Ladesma, who died a few years before
Gongora, obtained admirers for his poems, chiefly spiritual,
which he wrote in the obscure phraseology of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
<i>estilo culto</i>.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> For example, in paraphrazing the mysteries
of the catholic faith in lyric romances, he thus speaks
of the birth of the Saviour:&mdash;“The star of the east rose
at the time ordained by God, so that the enemy of day
might lose the prey he had seized, and with it the hope
of his false pretensions, as God assumed human flesh in
order that man might enjoy him,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> To men imbued
with superstition, and denied all reasoning in matters of
faith, ravings of this kind were well calculated to turn
their heads, and involve them in a vortex of romantic
mysticism.</p>

<p>Felix de Arteaga was likewise a zealous cultivator
of this distorted style, both in sacred and profane poetry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
In 1618, he held the post of court chaplain at Madrid,
and he lived until the year 1633. The chief portion
of his songs, romances, and sonnets, are of the pastoral
kind. He extols “the miracles of the fair Amarillis,
that angel of the superior class, to whom truth and passion
have given the name of Phœnix. She once espied
before her door a peasant, who, though not worthy to
adore her, was yet worthy to languish for her sake.
This happened one evening, which was a morning, since
Aurora smiled, and shewed white pearls between rows
of glowing carmine. The angel was amused by burning
those she had illumined, and this beautiful angel fell from
the heaven of her ownself,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> This author also wrote,
after the manner of Lope de Vega, a comedy, called
<i>Gridonia</i>, which he styles a royal invention, (<i>invencion
real</i>), because potentates, princes, and princesses are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
brought together from the most distant parts of the
earth, and introduced with vast scenic pomp.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a></p>

<p>Some of the adherents of this party, who were
distinguished for natural genius and ability, will be
hereafter noticed. We must not, however, neglect to
mention that the <i>estilo culto</i> likewise gained a footing
in Spanish America; and that various works in that
style by Alonzo de Castillo Solorzano, were very neatly
printed at Mexico in the year 1625.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a></p>

<h3 id="TWO_DRAMATIC_POETS">TWO DRAMATIC POETS OF THE AGE OF LOPE DE
VEGA.</h3>

<p>Lope de Vega had now become the model of the
Spanish dramatic poets, who soon appeared as numerous,
and laboured as assiduously as if they had been bound to
supply all the theatres in the universe with new pieces.
But most of these dramatists, who may altogether be considered
as forming one great school, were contemporary
with Lope de Vega only during their younger years.
The elegant Calderon, who was born in the year 1600,
may also have influenced the exercise of their talents.
In the history of the Spanish theatre, it will therefore
be proper to range together those dramatists on whom
it is probable the example of Calderon may have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
operated.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> This, however, is the proper place for
noticing two contemporaries of Lope de Vega.</p>

<p id="CHRISTOVAL_DE_VIRUES">The first of these writers, whose talents entitle
them to an honourable rank in literature, is Christoval
de Virues, a native of Valencia. He fought in the
battle of Lepanto, and is usually distinguished by his
military title of captain. The period of his death is
not known. Both Cervantes and Lope de Vega mention
him in terms of commendation. Virues was not
the pupil of Lope. Though older, as it would appear,
than that distinguished man, he was, like him, inspired
with enthusiasm for dramatic poetry; and they entered
upon the same career at nearly the same time. Virues
did not adhere more attentively than Lope to the strict
rules of the ancient drama. But he wanted the fertile
imagination of his rival, and he conceived it necessary
that the modern drama should approximate in a slight
degree to the antique, at least in some of its forms. He
was one of the Spanish dramatists by whom the last
attempts were made to separate tragedy from comedy;
and his efforts in this way are deserving of more praise
than has hitherto been conceded to them. Virues was
a poet born for tragic art; but his genius wanted cultivation.
Pure poetic spirit, and a bold and energetic
style, are the distinguishing features of all his works.
But, like Lope de Vega, he was every inch a Spaniard.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
He obeyed the influence of the national taste, and he
could not restrain his own genius within the bounds
which he had himself prescribed. Among his five tragedies
are some which might more properly be termed
comedies, according to the Spanish acceptation of the
term.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> It is obvious that Virues endeavoured to create
a sphere of his own, and that in proportion as he wrote
he made advances in his art. His <i>Semiramis</i>, the first
tragedy he wrote, which is chiefly in octaves, interspersed
here and there with redondillas, is crude both
in conception and execution; but the language even of
this imperfect drama, makes energetic approaches to
that genuine expression of tragic pathos, which Cervantes
and the elder Argensola in some measure
attained.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> His tragedy, entitled <i>La Cruel Casandra</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
which is richer in dramatic spirit, and more finished
and systematic in its execution, might in the hands of a
writer of genius be easily rendered a tragic master-piece.
Virues selected from the history of the kingdom of Leon,
the subject of this tragedy, in which he intended to
unite the ancient and modern styles.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> That a drama
of intrigue, like the <i>Casandra</i>, should not have obtained
greater popularity in Spain would be inexplicable, were
it not for the dislike which the Spanish public manifested
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
towards all dramas in which the tragic character
was exhibited without the intervention of comic scenes.
Cultivated taste will, however, perceive many faults in
this tragedy. The uninterrupted delirium of passion,
which prevails from the beginning to the end of the piece,
renders the whole more astounding than impressive.
The stormy movement of the action has, notwithstanding,
in most of the scenes, a very captivating effect; and that
passionate vehemence, in the painting of which Virues
was eminently successful, is, in this drama, characteristically
Spanish. The horrible deaths with which the
piece closes, and which, according to the nature of the
catastrophe were by no means necessary, are likewise
in unison with the spirit of a Spanish national tragedy.
The spring of action is the wicked spirit of a revengeful
woman whom jealousy betrays into a series of the most
treacherous intrigues. The dialogue is occasionally
somewhat declamatory; but in its best parts it is
energetic and unconstrained.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> Of all the dramas of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
Virues, his <i>Marcella</i> in which princes, princesses, robbers,
peasants, and servants, are jumbled together in
irregular confusion, was doubtless most in unison with
the Spanish taste.</p>

<p id="PEREZ_DE_MONTALVAN">The other Spanish dramatist who remains to be
noticed among the poetic writers of the age of Lope
de Vega, is Juan Perez de Montalvan, whom Lope
himself regarded as his first pupil, and who obtained,
probably through the interest of his patron, the post of
notary to the inquisition. He was a young man of
distinguished talent, and even in his seventeenth year
he wrote plays in the style of Lope de Vega. He first
entered the lists in competition with his master, after
whose death he pursued his literary occupations with
such assiduity, that when he died in 1639, though aged
only thirty-five, the number of his comedies and autos
amounted to nearly one hundred. He was also the
author of several novels, which will be particularly
noticed in another place. He put together in a single
volume, some of his dramas and novels, and his moral
reflections, full of formal erudition; and this singular
compilation was published under the no less singular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
title of Book for All.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> His comedies are neither more
finished nor more systematic than those of his master,
but they prove how easily a Spanish writer of imagination
might, in that age, be roused to venture into
competition with the inexhaustible Lope de Vega, and
also how far a poet of talent, with a certain degree of
practice, was capable of succeeding in dramatic intrigue.
Montalvan’s comedies possess, however, a more particular
interest, inasmuch as they exhibit traces of genius,
which under other circumstances would have constituted
a painter of dramatic character. In two of his
historical comedies, he has introduced Henry IV. of
France, and Philip II. of Spain. A kind of moral
dignity, almost approaching to sanctity, is falsely attributed
to the latter; but the prominent features of his
character are truly seized and strikingly delineated.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
The amiable Henry IV. is, however, pourtrayed to the
life.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> In his <i>Autos Sacramentales</i>, Montalvan even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
ventured to differ from Lope de Vega, in order to give to
these dramas the popular character which Lope had sacrificed
in his allegorical moralities. He composed an auto
on the romantic conversion of Skanderbeg, in which
drums, trumpets, clarionets, explosions of squibs and
rockets, and all the pomp of spectacle is introduced. But
the most extravagant creation of Montalvan’s fancy, is his
auto of <i>Polyphemus</i>, in which the cyclops of that name
appears as the allegorical representative of judaism; and
the rest of the cyclops, together with the nymph Galathæa,
and other mythological beings, are introduced for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
the allegorical personation of faith and infidelity, according
to christian notions. To these characters are
added, Appetite as a peasant, Joy as a lady, and finally
the Infant Christ. Drum and trumpet accompaniments
are not forgotten in this auto. The cyclops too perform
on the guitar; and an island sinks amidst a tremendous
explosion of fire works.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></p>

<h3 id="NOVELS_IN_THE_AGE_OF_CERVANTES">NOVELS IN THE AGE OF CERVANTES AND LOPE
DE VEGA.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding that poetry, sometimes under heterogeneous,
sometimes under harmonizing forms, was,
next to religion, the object which principally interested
the Spanish public in the age of Cervantes and Lope
de Vega, yet elegant prose was not consigned to such
obscurity as to engage only the attention of the learned.
The old Spanish soundness of understanding which
particularly displayed itself in Cervantes and the two
Argensolas, still, in some measure maintained its influence.
But upon the whole that rhetorical cultivation
which had been so early developed in Spain was
obviously on the decline.</p>

<p>Novels and romances, either decidedly bad or very
indifferent, were as widely circulated as rapidly produced,
and so great was their number that they counteracted
the good effects which the master-piece of Cervantes
must necessarily have produced under more
favourable circumstances. If few new romances of
chivalry were now written, the old ones were read with
the greater avidity. After the Galatea of Cervantes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
any very successful production in pastoral romance
was scarcely to be expected. Romances, depicting the
manners of modern society, were, however, proportionally
the more numerous. Among the best of the
serious, but yet spirited productions of this class, is the
Life of <i>Marcos de Obregon</i>;<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> by the poet and musician
Vicente Espinel.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> The object of the author was,
in his old age, to transmit useful instruction to the rising
generation in the form of a novel. The Spanish title
in which the hero of the story is styled an <i>Escudero</i>,
would seem to indicate a romance of chivalry, but the
whole character of the work is modern. The Escudero
is a sort of gentleman or squire by courtesy, and by no
means a shield-bearer. The book is intended as a
moral warning for young men without fortune, who
hope to get honourably through the world by attaching
themselves to persons of distinction. The story, though
entertaining, presents nothing particularly attractive;
the narration is rather prolix, but still natural; and the
diction plainly denotes the classic pupil of the sixteenth
century, though Espinel, as he states in his preface,
consigned his romance to the correction of Lope de
Vega, whom he styles the “divine genius,” after having
himself revised the verses which Lope composed in his
youth. The insipid jokes which occur in Marcos de
Obregon, for example those in derision of the Portuguese
and their language, must be considered as belonging
to the natural local colouring of the work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span></p>

<p>Among the romances of knavery, (<i>del gusto picaresco</i>),
the celebrated Don Guzman de Alfarache may
claim a distinguished place next to Lazarillo de Tormes.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a>
It was published in the year 1599, and consequently
before Don Quixote appeared. Like Lazarillo de Tormes
it was speedily translated into Italian and French, and
was subsequently published in various other languages,
not excepting the latin. Mattheo Aleman, the author
of Guzman de Alfarache, who had withdrawn from the
court of Philip III. and lived in retirement, was not
induced by the success of his comic romance, to devote
himself to a second production of the same class. The
knowledge of the world which he had acquired at court,
as well as in the sphere of common life, is doubtless
abundantly unfolded in his Guzman de Alfarache. The
manners of the lower classes of Spanish society, in
particular, seem to be pourtrayed with admirable accuracy.
In spite of the vulgarity of the subject, and the
burlesque style in which it is treated, no ordinary share
of judgment is perceptible throughout the whole of this
comic novel; and in his humorous language the author
has preserved a certain degree of natural elegance even
in describing the lowest scenes.</p>

<p>That the Spaniards were by no means sparing
of approbation to works of this class, is obvious from
the attention bestowed on the mannered continuation of
Aleman’s romance, by a writer styling himself Mattheo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
Luzan, and still more by the favour lavished upon <i>La
Picara Justina</i>, a silly and pedantic pendant to Guzman
de Alfarache, by a writer named Ubeda. In Cervantes’s
Journey to Parnassus, no literary production of
the age is so categorically condemned as this <i>Picara
Justina</i>. And yet it was oftener printed, and probably
more read than even the Journey to Parnassus.</p>

<p>Little anecdotal stories of a sprightly character, likewise
made their appearance in Spanish literature at this
period. A collection of these productions, connected
together by means of dialogues, was published in 1610,
under the title of Pleasant Dialogues for the Carnival
time, (<i>Dialogos de Apacible Entretenimiento</i>), by
Gaspar Lucas Hidalgo.</p>

<p>The political romance of Argenis, was pompously
arranged to suit the taste of the Spaniards of that age,
by the Gongorist Pellicer de Salas.</p>

<p>Among the novels which possessed more of an imaginative
character, the best then produced were those
of Perez de Montalvan, the dramatic poet.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></p>

<p>The present is not the proper place to introduce a
complete or copious list of all the works in the class
above alluded to. Other writers have already enumerated
them with sufficient accuracy.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> Unfortunately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
even the very best of these novels and narratives present
no traces of the advancement of taste and literary
cultivation.</p>

<p>The novels of a Spanish lady, named Doña Mariana
de Caravajal y Saavedra, must not be passed over without
a particular notice. Respecting this authoress, who
was a native of the city of Granada, but little is said
by the writers on Spanish literature. Her ten novels
have been frequently reprinted, and were apparently
very well received by the public.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> Doña Mariana states
in her preface, that her novels are intended to afford
amusement in “the lazy nights of chill winter;”<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> and
they may, even now, be recommended to those who
stand in need of such amusement; for they are by no
means devoid of fancy though they are written in a
style of affected verbosity. The verses with which the
tales are interspersed, exhibit no traces of poetic talent.
In her preface, the authoress promises to present to the
Spanish public, twelve comedies “from her ill-made pen,”
as a proof of the “kindness of her intention.”<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> Spain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
could indeed scarcely be expected to give birth to a
poetess in the true sense of the term. The terrible
yoke imposed on the conscience and the understanding,
against which even masculine genius could only contend
by boldly plunging into the wilds of romantic invention,
weighed still more heavily on the female mind, which
without a certain spirit of freedom can seldom range
beyond the boundaries established by custom, and the
routine of ordinary thinking. Writers on Spanish
literature, however, mention in terms of approbation,
several female writers of verses, and also women of
erudition, like Aloysia Sigea, distinguished for their
knowledge of languages.</p>

<h3 id="PROGRESSIVE_CULTIVATION_OF_THE_HISTORICAL_ART">PROGRESSIVE CULTIVATION OF THE HISTORICAL
ART&mdash;MARIANA.</h3>

<p>At this period of Spanish eloquence, history was
the only kind of composition which maintained its old
precision and dignity, while of the perfect cultivation
of the other branches of prose literature there remained
little hope.</p>

<p>The General History of Spain, by the Jesuit Juan
de Mariana, though not a model of historical art in the
most extended sense of the term, is, in point of style,
unquestionably a classic production. Mariana, who
may be said to have transferred the genuine spirit
of the eloquence of the sixteenth century into the
seventeenth,<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> was not one of the pensioned historiographers
or chroniclers who have already been frequently
mentioned, and who, it must be confessed, honourably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
discharged their duties. He obtained reputation both
in France and Italy as a professor of scholastic philosophy
and theology; but his love of literary retirement
induced him to return to Spain. Of his own free
choice he undertook to compose a new general History
of Spain from the earliest period to the death of
Ferdinand the catholic. His predecessors had been
sufficiently numerous, and he did not find it necessary to
collect the materials for his history by laborious compilations
from the old authors and chroniclers of the
middle ages. He was thus at liberty to prescribe to
himself a more pleasing task, namely, that of judiciously
combining the most interesting events, and
describing them with rhetorical precision in elegant
language. With the view of acquiring a prose style,
formed in the spirit of the classic historians of antiquity,
Mariana composed his work originally in latin,<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> a
method which Cardinal Bembo had adopted in writing
his History of Venice. After he had completed this first
labour, and dedicated the thirty books of his history in
latin to Philip II. he followed the example of Bembo in
translating it himself, and he in fact recomposed it in
Spanish.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> This work he also dedicated to the king.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
Though this twofold dedication might have served to
prove that the author was far from being liable to the
imputation of cherishing views dangerous to the state, yet
a party, with whose designs several passages of this history
did not accord, found it easy under the government
of the ever jealous Philip, to cast on Mariana the suspicion
of favouring wicked and rebellious principles. He
was formally brought before the inquisition, and it was
with difficulty he escaped destruction. Had he devoted
more attention to the philosophy of history, he could not
so easily have repelled the charge of impartiality, to aim
at which was then considered an unwarrantable assumption
not to be tolerated in any Spanish writer. But it
is only in his style that Mariana was impartial. To
exhibit facts as they stood in their natural connection,
was sufficient to give umbrage to the court and the
inquisition; and solely to such an exposition was it
owing, that the historian’s intentions became a subject
of suspicion. Elegant composition was his grand object;
and in this respect he far excels Bembo, because
he is not, like him, mannered. His diction is perfectly
faultless, his descriptions picturesque without poetic ornament;
and his narrative style may, on the whole, be accounted
a model. He has been very successful in avoiding
protracted and artificially constructed sentences.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
Mariana could not, however, resist the temptation of
putting speeches into the mouths of his historical
characters, after the manner of the ancient historians.
In fine, comparing this history with other works of a
similar kind, which previously existed in Spanish literature,
it will be found that, though justly entitled to a high
share of esteem, it cannot be regarded as forming an
epoch either in a philosophic or literary point of view.</p>

<p>Having described the rise and progress of the historical
art in Spain, it cannot be necessary to give a
minute notice of historical works, which for the most
part possess only the negative merit of not being ill
written. The age of Cervantes and Lope de Vega was,
moreover, the period at which the historical literature
of the Spaniards began to form itself into that perfect
whole for which it is so peculiarly remarkable. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
that time the old chronicles were committed to the
press one after another: and the continuation and correction
of the national history was the only literary
occupation which could be pursued with any hope of
success by men of talent, who felt no impulse to poetry;
unless, indeed, they preferred to distinguish themselves
in scholastic theology, or in writing books of pious
edification, in which it was, above all things, necessary
to take care to say nothing new.</p>

<p>It is still less necessary to enter upon a detailed
examination of various works in the didactic department
of Spanish literature, which are upon the whole
not badly written, but not one of which exceeds in
rhetorical merit the works of Perez de Oliva, Ambrosio
de Morales, and other authors, who have already been
mentioned. The writings of Balthasar, or Lorenzo
Gracian, who endeavoured to introduce a kind of
<i>gongorism</i> into Spanish prose, will be more fully
noticed at the close of the present book.</p>

<h3 id="FLUCTUATION_OF_SPANISH_TASTE">FLUCTUATION OF SPANISH TASTE FROM THE CLASSIC
TO THE CORRUPT STYLE.</h3>

<p>In order to mark, by sensible gradations, the transition
from the golden age of Spanish poetry and
eloquence, to those sad times, when the energy of the
national genius was, after a long conflict with opposing
circumstances, destined to be overcome, it will be proper
first to notice some poets and prose authors, who during
the latter half of the period embraced by the present
section, assumed a tone peculiar to themselves; and also,
another set of writers who were their immediate successors.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
Quevedo may with propriety be placed at their
head. During a part of his life he was contemporary
with Cervantes, Lope de Vega, and the Argensolas, and
was, moreover, an opposer of the New Art of Gongora.
But both in poetry and prose he deviates so strikingly
from the classic, and so obviously approaches the ornamented
and artificial style, that by commencing with him
the retrograde course which Spanish literature began to
take even in the period of its highest cultivation, will
be most distinctly perceived.</p>

<h3 id="QUEVEDO">QUEVEDO.</h3>

<p>The circumstances of the life of Francisco de Quevedo
Villegas,<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> a man who has almost invariably been
praised or censured with partiality, had a most important
influence on the developement and employment of his
talents. He began even in childhood to breathe the air
of courts. He was born, in 1580, at Madrid, of a
noble family, and was educated at the court under the
care of his widowed mother who was one of the ladies
of the royal household. An eager curiosity was the
first indication of his active and restless mind; and the
impressions which he received in his infancy, induced
him to make the scholastic theology of catholicism his
first study in preference to every other kind of knowledge.
He was sent to the university of Alcala, where
he received the degree of doctor in theology in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
fifteenth year, a fact which appears almost incredible.
Grown weary of theology, he directed his attention to
law, philology, natural philosophy, medicine, and elegant
literature; and he pursued all these studies without
any regular order. It is probable that at this period
he injured his sight by indefatigable reading; for in the
prime of life he was incapable of distinguishing any
object at the distance of three paces, without the aid of
glasses. But neither this infirmity nor the crooked legs
which he had received from nature, deterred him from
mingling in fashionable society. His figure, which was
in other respects strong and well proportioned, joined to
his prepossessing countenance, contributed in no slight
degree to the early developement of his self-esteem.</p>

<p>Quevedo returned to the court of Madrid, with a
mind stored with all kinds of academic knowledge.
But he soon became engaged in a dispute, fought a
duel in which he wounded his antagonist, and was
compelled to fly. He proceeded to Italy, where the
Spanish Viceroy of Naples, Don Pedro Giron, Duke of
Ossuna, interested himself for the accomplished fugitive.
He procured his pardon at Madrid, and retained him in
his service at Naples. Quevedo now became a statesman
and a man of business. He played the most prominent
part at the court of the Vice-king, executed important
commissions, visited the papal court, in quality of ambassador,
was rewarded with titles and pensions, and
seemed to be the favourite of fortune. But he was
suddenly cast down by the fall of his patron, the Duke
of Ossuna. Quevedo was connected with that powerful
grandee in all his transactions, and thus became involved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
in his fate. In 1620, in the fortieth year of his age,
he was arrested and removed to his country seat, La
Torre de Juan Abad, where he was, by the order of
the government, confined during three years, notwithstanding
his delicate state of health, which this restraint
rendered daily worse. So rigidly was this kind of imprisonment
enforced, that it was with great difficulty
he could obtain leave to go to a neighbouring town to
commit himself to the care of a physician in whom he
could confide.</p>

<p>At length Quevedo’s papers being strictly examined,
his innocence became unquestionable, and he was set at
liberty. He now demanded indemnification and the payment
of the arrears of his pension. Instead, however, of
obtaining attention to his claims, he was threatened with
a new exile, and received an order to quit the court.
This sentence he found means to evade, and even court
intrigue seemed at last inclined to favour him; but in
the conflict between vanity and reason, Quevedo in due
time proved himself a philosopher. He willingly forsook
the court, retired to his estate of La Torre, and devoted
himself wholly to literary pursuits. It is probable that
at this period he wrote the poems which on their first
appearance were published as the works of the Bachelor
de la Torre, an old poet of the fifteenth century. The
name of his country residence apparently suggested to
Quevedo the disguise of the above title. There is also
reason to suppose that at this period he wrote the
greater portion of his works both in prose and verse.
But these writings, which overflow with wit and satire,
and display that firmness of judgment and character,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
which is always so unwelcome at courts, tended to keep
alive the attention of those who conceived themselves
to be attacked. As the crisis of his varied fate approached,
Quevedo seems to have totally forgotten the
intrigues of which he had been the victim. He had
already passed several years in literary tranquillity, and
was upwards of fifty years of age when he married.
But his wife, to whom he was tenderly attached, did
not live long. Quevedo’s evil star once more induced
him to visit Madrid, where in 1641, he was arrested at
midnight in the house of a friend with whom he resided.
The charge preferred against him, was that of being a
libeller, who spared neither the government nor public
morals; he was thrown into a small and unwholesome
prison, and treated with the most rigid severity, not
even experiencing the humanity usually extended to
the vilest criminals. In the meanwhile his property
was sequestrated, and though not convicted of any
crime, he was compelled to subsist on charity. He was
again seized with a severe fit of illness. His body broke
out in ulcers, in consequence of the insalubrity of his
prison, but he was even then denied the aid of a surgeon.
In this situation Quevedo appealed for justice to the
Duke of Olivares, the all-powerful prime minister of
Spain, in a letter which has become celebrated. His
case was now, for the first time, strictly investigated;
and it was ascertained that he had merely been supposed
to be the author of a libel, which was subsequently discovered
to have been written in a monastery. Quevedo
once more regained his freedom, but with the loss of a
considerable portion of his fortune, of which indeed he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
retained so scanty a remnant, that he was unable to
continue long enough in Madrid to solicit the indemnification
which was so justly due to him, and without which
he could not subsist with respectability. A prey to
sickness, and deprived of the hope of ever obtaining
justice, he retired to his country seat, and there died in
the year 1645.</p>

<p>A man who, like Quevedo, reaped the bitterest
fruits from political justice, cannot be very heavily
reproached for seizing in his satires every opportunity
of more severely chastising and ridiculing the ministers
of that justice, than any other enemies of truth and
equity. But Quevedo was not a mere satirist. He may,
without hesitation, be pronounced the most ingenious
of all Spanish writers, next to Cervantes; and his mind
was, moreover, endowed with a degree of practical judgment,
which is seldom found combined with that versatility
for which he was distinguished. Could Quevedo have
ruled the taste and genius of his nation and his age in
the same degree in which that taste and genius influenced
him, his versatility, joined to his talent for
composing verses with no less rapidity than Lope de
Vega, might have rendered him, if not a poet of the
first rank in the loftier region of art, at least a classic
writer of almost unrivalled merit. But this scholar
and man of the world was too early wedded to conventional
forms of every kind. It may indeed be said
that he was steeped in all the colours of his age. A
true feeling of the independence of genius never animated
him, lofty as his spirit in other respects was.
His taste imbibed some portion of all the conflicting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
tastes which at that period existed in Spain. His style
never acquired originality, and his mind was only half
cultivated.</p>

<p id="CHARACTER_OF_HIS_BEST_WORKS">Quevedo’s writings, taken altogether in verse and in
prose, resemble a massy ornament of jewellery, in which
the setting of some parts is exquisitely skilful, of others
extremely rude, and in which the number of false stones
and of gems of inestimable value are nearly equal. His
most numerous, and unquestionably his best productions,
are those of the satirical and comic kind. Though
Quevedo did not strike into a totally new course, yet
by a union peculiar to himself of sports of fancy, with
the maxims of reason and morality, he evidently enlarged
the sphere of satirical and comic poetry in
Spanish literature. He occasionally approached, though
he never equalled, the delicacy and correctness of Cervantes.
His wit is sufficiently caustic; but it is accompanied
by a coarseness which would be surprising,
considering his situation in life, were it not that Quevedo,
as an author, sought to indemnify himself for the
constraint to which, as a man of the world he was compelled
to submit. For this reason, perhaps, he bestowed
but little pains on the correction of his satires. His
ideas are striking; and are thrown together sometimes
with absolute carelessness, sometimes with refined precision;
but for the most part in a distorted and mannered
strain of language. This mixed character of
cultivation and rudeness peculiarly characterizes his
satirical and comic works in verse, in which, as he himself
says, he has exhibited “truth in her smock, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
not quite naked.”<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> He appears as the rival of Gongora
in numerous comic canciones and romances in the
old national style.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> In these compositions he humorously
parodied the extravagant images of the
Marinists,<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> and the affected singularity of the Gongorists.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
Quevedo wrote no inconsiderable number of his
comic and satirical poems in the jargon of the Spanish
gypsies; and it is therefore probable that they are not intelligible
to many readers on this side of the Pyrenees.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
These romances and canciones, which were distinguished
by the name of Xacaras, were rendered so extremely popular
by Quevedo, that even down to the present day
the Spaniards continue to admire them.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> His Bayles,
or comic dancing songs, are, on account of their numerous
allusions to national peculiarities, no less obscure
to foreigners than the Xacaras.</p>

<p>Of all the Spanish poets, Quevedo has been the
most successful writer of burlesque sonnets in the
Italian manner. Some of these sonnets he shortened
by depriving them of the three last of their legitimate
number of lines, while the Italians on the contrary,
attached to theirs the comic sequel which they called
the <i>Coda</i>.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> Quevedo’s productions in this class are,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
for the most part, like their Italian models, full of
allusions which cannot be understood without the
assistance of a commentary. Some have a piquant
sententious turn. But that licentious humour which
distinguishes this species of composition in Italian
literature Quevedo renounced, either voluntarily or from
fear of the inquisition. Besides his burlesque sonnets,
he wrote canciones and madrigals in the same style.</p>

<p>Quevedo’s satires in the manner of Juvenal, naturally
connect themselves with his burlesque poems.
Like his model he has infused into them nearly as
much poetry as the satirical style is capable of receiving.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a>
These compositions display the noblest enthusiasm
for truth and justice,<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> and the most patriotic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
zeal for the honour of Spain,<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> forcibly and clearly
expressed.</p>

<p>Quevedo’s satires in verse and his poems of humour,
are not so well known out of Spain as his prose writings
of the same description, of which the most remarkable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
are his Visions or Dreams, and his novel of the Great
Tacaño, or the Captain of Thieves, called Don Pablos,
(<i>Vida del Buscon</i>, llamado D. Pablos), which certainly
may be regarded as the most burlesque of the knavery
romances.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> Lucian furnished him with the original
idea of satirical visions; but Quevedo’s were the first
of their kind in modern literature. Owing to frequent
imitations, their faults are now no longer disguised by
the charm of novelty, and even their merits have ceased
to interest. Still, however, they must be regarded as
ingenious productions abounding in practical truths.
They are not, it is true, remarkable either for delicate
satire or pure philosophy. But Quevedo’s object was
to scourge human folly and vice in the mass; and the
severe lashes which he deals out in his Visions, are in
excellent unison with the popular nature of the idea
and the poignant style of its execution. He has made
perverted Justice, with all her servants and satellites, and
particularly the Alguazils, figure in the fore ground of
his picture; but the melancholy fate of the author may
well excuse, though even in the visionary world, these
monotonous features in his satirical work. Among the
passages for which no just excuse can be found, are some
disgusting descriptions of the consequences of physical
excess. The reader is occasionally surprised by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
humorous sallies with which Quevedo breaks forth in
these Visions; for example, in that of the Last Judgment,
in which he describes “some merchants who
had placed their souls across their bodies, so that their
five senses got into the finger nails of their right
hand.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a>”</p>

<p>For the serious works of Quevedo, we must refer
to his poems, as his serious compositions in prose
are in general of a theological and ascetic character.
The sonnets, canciones, odes and pastoral poems, which
he published under the name of the Bachelor de la
Torre, are even at the present day highly extolled by
critics;<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> and these poems have certainly more correctness
than most of Quevedo’s other works. But they
chiefly consist of imitations of the Spanish Petrarchist
style, which was always foreign to Quevedo; and notwithstanding
the great elegance of language and versification
which distinguish them, they are surcharged with antiquated
phrases of affected gallantry. The <i>snows</i> which
<i>inflame</i> the poet, and similar tropes in which the beauty
of a mistress is brilliantly set forth, occasionally call to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
mind the style of the Italian Marinists. Nevertheless
some of these sonnets well deserve the favour which
has been extended to them.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> Quevedo’s <i>Endechas</i>, or
Laments, have a pleasing national character.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> The
pastoral poems contained in this collection, approximate
to the good specimens of the sixteenth century.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
Quevedo evidently wished to prove what he was capable
of producing in this style of composition.</p>

<p>The serious poems of which Quevedo has avowed
himself the author, are very unequal in character.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a>
His didactic and sententious sonnets are energetic, but
deficient in delicacy.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> Some of the best assume a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
satirical turn.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> His odes in the Pindaric style are,
however, stiff and formal. He wrote a piece of moral
declamation in verse, called <i>Sermon Estoyco</i>, (Estoical
Sermon), which is in truth precisely what the title
denotes.</p>

<p>That Quevedo entertained very vague notions respecting
poetry, is particularly evident from the whim
which induced him to translate in rhymed verse, the
stoical Enchiridion, or Manual of Epictetus. The translation
is, however, much esteemed by the Spaniards.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a></p>

<h3 id="VILLEGAS">VILLEGAS.</h3>

<p>An Anacreon was still wanting to Spanish literature,
though various attempts in the Anacreontic style had
been made. That a poet penetrated at once with the
classic spirit of Anacreon, Horace and Catullus, should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
now arise, and become the favourite of the Spanish
public, was a thing scarcely to be expected; for all the
resources of amatory poetry in the only style which
had hitherto been found agreeable to Spanish taste,
seemed to be exhausted. The poetry of Villegas,
however, produced precisely for this reason the more
powerful impression on a public which ardently longed
for entertainment.</p>

<p>Estèvan Manuel de Villègas, was born in the year
1595, at Nagera, or Naxera, a little town in Old Castile.
The history of his life is simple. His parents who
were noble, though not rich, sent him to study at
Madrid and Salamanca. His taste for poetry was
developed at a very early period. Even in his fifteenth
year he translated Anacreon, and several of the odes
of Horace in verse; and likewise imitated those poets
in original compositions. In his twentieth year he gave
the finishing touch to his youthful effusions, and added
to the collection of his translated and original poems, a
second part, which has since been published conjointly
with them.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> He soon after printed the whole collection
at his own expence at Naxera, under the title of <i>Amatorias</i>;
but in the interior of the book, the poems are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
styled <i>Eroticas</i>.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> Villegas ventured to dedicate these
poems, together with the part added to them, to which a
particular title might more properly have been assigned,
to Philip III. though individual parts of the collection
had previously been addressed to other patrons. That
so indolent a monarch as Philip III. should have accepted
the dedication of such a collection, may not be
surprising, and the freedom was pardonable in a young
author of three-and-twenty. But this dedication is, in
another respect, remarkable in the history of Spanish
literature; for the <i>Eroticas</i> of Villegas contain some
passages, which though not wanting in delicacy of expression,
are nevertheless so extremely free, that it is
wonderful how they happened to escape the censure of
the inquisition. The dedication was, however, productive
of neither good nor evil to the poet. For several years
he vainly solicited a lucrative office; and was at last
obliged to content himself with the scanty emolument
arising from an insignificant post in Naxera, his native
town. From that time he devoted his leisure to the
composition of philological works in the latin language;
and though he produced nothing new for Spanish poetry,
he made a prose translation of five books of Boethius.
He lived till the year 1669.</p>

<p>The graceful luxuriance of the poetry of Villegas
has no parallel in modern literature; and, generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
speaking, no modern writer has so well succeeded in
blending the spirit of ancient poetry with the modern.
But constantly to observe that correctness of ideas,
which distinguished the classical compositions of antiquity,
was by Villegas, as by most Spanish poets, considered
too rigid a requisition, and an unnecessary restraint
on genius. He accordingly sometimes degenerates into
conceits and images, the monstrous absurdity of which
are characteristic of the author’s nation and age. For
instance, in one of his odes in which he entreats Lyda
to suffer her tresses to flow, he says, that “when agitated
by Zephyr, her locks would occasion a thousand
deaths, and subdue a thousand lives;”<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> and then he
adds, in a strain of extravagance, surpassing that of
the Marinists, “that the sun himself would cease to
give light, if he did not snatch beams from her radiant
countenance to illumine the east.”<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> But faults of this
glaring kind, are by no means frequent in the poetry of
Villegas; and the fascinating grace with which he
emulates his models, operates with so powerful a charm,
that the occasional occurrence of some little affectations,
from which he could scarcely be expected entirely to
abstain, is easily overlooked by the reader.</p>

<p>The order in which the poetic works of Villegas
are arranged, is by no means the best; but as it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
chosen by the author, it is proper that it should be
observed in pursuing a notice of the poems themselves.
The first book of the first part commences with thirty-six
odes in the style of some of the odes of Horace.
The Dedicatory Ode addressed to the king, announces,
in language truly charming, the spirit of the whole
collection.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> Then follow in a similar strain, the most
delightful plays of fancy, abounding in classical allusions,
without the least trace of pedantry. The style of
Villegas even imparts a charm of novelty to descriptions
of the oftenest described things.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> In these odes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
romantic levity assumes freedoms, which if not always
of the most excusable, are invariably of the most graceful
description;<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> and the soft and melodious expression of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
tender passion, which in more than one instance occurs,
has never been surpassed.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a></p>

<p>The second book of the first division of the poems of
Villegas, consists of odes, which are free translations of
the first book of Horace. It ought not, therefore, to have
been ranked under the same title with the other poems in
the collection. There is something pedantic in the generical
titles by which he distinguishes the different odes;
for example&mdash;<i>Memptica</i>, <i>Enetica</i>, <i>Parænetica</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>With the third book of the first division commence
the Anacreontic songs, or as they are styled in the
collection, the <i>Delicias</i> of the poet. Their measure is
chiefly anacreontic, sometimes in blank verse, and at
other times presenting the most pleasing alternation of
rhymes and assonances. Light pleasing images and soft
luxuriant ideas float through these songs even more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
gracefully than in the odes attributed to Anacreon.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a>
Nothing can exceed the beauty of those in which a
certain delicate moral feeling is combined with a
pathetic simplicity.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> Only a few can be said to be
absolutely copied from the greek or latin originals.</p>

<p>The fourth book of the first part, contains the complete
translation of the greek odes ascribed to Anacreon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
The second division is chiefly occupied with elegies and
idyls, or <i>eidillios</i>, as Villegas, in hellenizing the term,
chooses to call them. The elegies which might with
greater propriety be denominated epistles, do not belong
to the best of the kind in Spanish literature; in the
idyls, or mythological tales, as they ought to be called,
Villegas appears as one of the <i>Cultoristos</i>, or disciples
of the school of Gongora.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span></p>

<p>The collection concludes with several imitations
of greek and latin verse, which may be regarded as
the first compositions of the kind in Spanish, that
were not complete failures. Doubtless the Spanish
language adapts itself somewhat more readily to the
ancient metres than the Italian; for final syllables
sounded in pronunciation, but subject to elision in
scanning, do not occur so frequently in Spanish as in
Italian.&mdash;This difference is, however, in reality but of
trivial importance; and Spanish verses in the ancient
syllabic measures do not flow much more naturally than
the Italian compositions of the same kind; because
many words derived from the latin, have received
in Spanish, as well as in Italian, a modern quantity,<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a>
which is generally confounded with the ancient
quantity by the imitators of the greek and latin
metres. The Spanish hexameters of Villegas, it is
true, approach in point of facility to the hexameters
of antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> But the pentameters defied his imitative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
talent.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> In his sapphic verse the measure resolves
into iambics: one of these sapphic odes is, however,
exquisitely beautiful.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a></p>

<h3 id="CONTINUATION_OF_THE_HISTORY_OF_LYRIC" class="hang">CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF LYRIC, BUCOLIC,
EPIC, DIDACTIC, AND SATIRICAL POETRY, TO
THE CLOSE OF THE PERIOD EMBRACED BY THIS
SECTION.</h3>

<p>After Quevedo and Villegas, and before entering
upon the notice of a series of dramatic poets, whose
works must form a subject of separate consideration, it
will be necessary to mention several ingenious writers,
who, though endowed with eminent talents, were nevertheless
unable to retard the fast approaching close of
the golden era of Spanish poesy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span></p>

<h3 id="JAUREGUI">JAUREGUI.</h3>

<p>If pure diction, joined to a descriptive style of the
most perfect kind, might form a sufficient claim to the
title of poet of the first rank, the right of Juan de Jauregui,
or Xauregui, to that distinction, among the Spanish
poets of the first half of the seventeenth century, could
not be disputed. Jauregui, who was of Biscayan origin,
but educated in the interior of Spain, first developed his
talents in Italy. In that country he prosecuted his poetic
studies, and at the same time thought it no degradation
to practise painting as a profession, though he was a nobleman
and a knight of the order of Calatrava. He is
said to have excelled in painting even more than in poetry.
While in Italy he made a Spanish translation of
Tasso’s Amynta, in which he was so successful, that the
translation is still regarded by the educated portion of
his countrymen as possessing the characteristics of the
happiest original composition. Jauregui was a decided
opponent of the Gongorists; but his taste did not
coincide with that of Quevedo. He devoted much
talent and industry to a free translation of Lucan’s
Pharsalia in octaves. He died in 1610; and his poetic
remains, exclusive of his translations, are by no means
numerous. The translation of Lucan was not published
till long after the death of Jauregui; but ever since its
appearance, the Spaniards have admired it as a classic
composition; and it unquestionably possesses all the merit
that the translation of such a work can possibly present.
But from a man who could be induced to apply so much
labour and time to a translation of Lucan, no very extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
proofs of poetic talent were to be expected;
and it must be confessed that Jauregui, in none of his
compositions has risen above what may be called the
poetry of style. He might have carried this kind of
merit still farther, had not his Lucan led him into a
kind of mannered affectation. Among his original works,
his <i>Orfeo</i>, a mythological tale, in five cantos, deserves to
be distinguished.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> But his lyric poems, and particularly
his sonnets, bear evident traces of the man of genius
and of cultivated mind.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> Jauregui’s dramatic compositions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
which were written with the view of reforming
the national taste, are now lost to literature, and were
at the time of their production indignantly banished
from the stage. He is the author of some small works
in prose, one of which is a treatise on painting.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a></p>

<h3 id="BORJA_Y_ESQUILLACHE">BORJA Y ESQUILLACHE.</h3>

<p>Prince Francisco de Borja y Esquillache, a knight
of the Golden Fleece, and for some time viceroy of
Peru, was the most distinguished, in point of birth, of
all the Spanish poets of his age.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> With regard to
cultivation, he may be placed on a level with Jauregui;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
but he deserves to rank higher in poetic invention.
Throughout his long life, which when he died in 1658,
had extended to nearly eighty years, he seems constantly
to have devoted a portion of his time to the study of
poetry; and though he was not entitled to the praises
lavished on him by his flatterers, who styled him the
Prince of Spanish Poets, he may be regarded as the
last representative of the classic style of the sixteenth
century. The collection of his sonnets, epistles, tales,
romances, and canciones, forms a large quarto volume,
the last half of which is printed in double columns.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a>
Prince Francisco de Borja, was likewise the author of an
unsuccessful epic poem, entitled, <i>Napoles Conquistada</i>,
and various works on sacred subjects. Though he did not
contribute to the advancement of Spanish poetry, yet
in all his writings, he decidedly opposed that subtlety and
affectation which in the time of Gongora usurped the
place of real genius. The intimate friendship he had
contracted in his youth with the younger Argensola, had
no doubt a favourable influence on the early developement
of his talent. In the preface to his poems, which
is in verse, he explains the principles of his taste with
so much accuracy, modesty and elegance, that the
reader cannot fail to be prepossessed in his favour,
before entering on an attentive perusal of his works.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
He was particularly averse to all kinds of affectation
and extravagance.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> Most of his sonnets bear traces of
mature reflection.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> His long tale of Jacob and Rachel,
(<i>Cantos de Jacob y Raquel</i>), in octaves, has indeed no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
other merit than that of elegant diction.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> His lyric
romances, however, of which he wrote upwards of two
hundred and fifty, present at once the richest and most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
beautiful gleanings in that species of poetic composition.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></p>

<h3 id="OTHER_POETS_OF_THIS_PERIOD">OTHER POETS OF THIS PERIOD&mdash;THE SYLVAS, OR
POETIC FORESTS.</h3>

<p>To enter into a detailed description of the works of
some other Spanish poets, with whom the old national
poetry and the Italian style equally perished, would be
the more unnecessary here, as these poets, though not
without genius, wanted proper cultivation, and merely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
followed in the general stream. Besides, there is no want
of literary notices which furnish abundant information
respecting Luis de Ulloa, Francisco de Rioja, Gravina,
Manuel de Mela, Juan de Tarsis, Count of Villamediana,
and others.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> It is, however, worthy of remark, that at
this period, as in the preceding ages, Spanish noblemen
and men of rank were particularly distinguished among
the candidates for poetic fame. The Poetic Forests,
(<i>Sylvas</i>), as they were styled, according to Gongora’s
nomenclature, but which were afterwards designated by
the common Spanish word <i>Selvas</i>, doubtless contributed
in no slight degree to hasten the decline of genuine poetry
in Spain. In these Forests rhymed prose could flow on
without obstruction, and every conceit was in its proper
place; for no fixed metre, and no unity of ideas or events
restrained the poet or versifier. The works of Count
Rebolledo, which are deserving of a particular notice,
will afford a sufficient idea of the direction thus given
to the lyric, didactic, narrative, and bucolic poetry of
Spain, in a general combination of all these styles.</p>

<h3 id="REBOLLEDO">REBOLLEDO.</h3>

<p>Bernardino, Count of Rebolledo, was one of the
heroes of the latter period of the thirty years war in
Germany. After having distinguished himself in the
military service both of Spain and Austria, he resided
for a considerable time in the quality of Spanish
ambassador at Copenhagen, where he watched over
the interests of his sovereign with reference to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
designs of the king of Sweden. His taste for military
and political affairs did not preclude the exercise of his
talent for poetry. But it was not until his mission to
Copenhagen, when he had attained the age of maturity,
that he found leisure to prosecute his poetic studies with
assiduity. Thus, for the first time, and perhaps for the
last, was Spanish poetry in the middle of the seventeenth
century, transplanted to Scandanavia. Count Rebolledo
was much pleased with his residence in Copenhagen;
and he rendered signal service to his Danish majesty,
when Charles Gustavus, King of Sweden, marched
across the frozen Belt, and bombarded the Danish
capital. Though a zealous catholic, he felt for the
royal house of Denmark a kind of personal devotion,
which he seized every opportunity of manifesting, both
in verse and prose. He took particular interest in the
study of the history and geography of Denmark, with
the view of describing them in Spanish verse. Having
returned to his native country, where he was appointed
minister of war, he died in 1676, in the eightieth year
of his age. His poems were, during his life, collected
and published under various titles.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> One of these collections,
entitled <i>Ocios</i>, (Leisure Hours), proves that Count
Rebolledo, though he only travelled in a long beaten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
tract, and even in that tract did not shine above his
contemporaries, possessed, nevertheless, a degree of
poetic cultivation, which was probably unparalleled in
Copenhagen in the age in which he lived. He was
particularly successful as a writer of elegant madrigals;<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a>
and he is the author of a play, entitled, <i>Amor</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
<i>Despreciando Riesgos</i>,<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> (Love Dreads no Danger),
which possesses considerable interest. But Rebolledo’s
name has been rendered still more remarkable in the
history of Spanish literature by his dull Forests, for which
he himself claimed the title of poetic, though they exhibit
only the last traces of Spanish poetry. Other
writers had already done their utmost to give importance
to the rhymed prose of these Forests. But Rebolledo so
completely mistook the essence of poetry, that he really
conceived he was executing works of high poetic merit,
when he put into verse a compendium of the History
and Geography of Denmark, entitled, <i>Selvas Danicas</i>,
and a treatise on the Art of War and State Policy,
entitled, <i>Selva Militar y Politica</i>. Whoever attempts
to travel through Rebolledo’s Danish Forests, will soon
find, especially if he have any recollection of genuine
Spanish poetry, that he has undertaken a very disagreeable
task. In the first half of the work, not a
single poetic or even ingenious trait enlivens the dry
enumeration of facts. What the author intended for a
narrative poem, is found to be merely an account of
the History of Denmark, related in the lowest style of
common place prose; and the multitude of northern
names, which partly retain their original spelling, and
are partly hispanized, have a peculiarly grotesque
effect.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> The geography of Denmark, which constitutes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
the second part of the work, presents a few poetic passages.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a>
But the Military and Political Forest, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
is intended for a didactic poem, is rhymed prose from
beginning to end. It is difficult to say whether the
principles of tactics,<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> or the instructions in the art of
government,<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> appear most ridiculous in the versified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
garb in which Rebolledo has clothed them. The worthy
author might with more propriety have applied the
title of poems to his <i>Selvas Sagradas</i>, (Sacred Forests),
which are translations of the psalms in the loose forms
of the Forests.</p>

<h3 id="CONTINUATION_OF_THE_HISTORY_OF_THE_SPANISH_DRAMA">CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF THE SPANISH
DRAMA.</h3>

<p>The feeling of regret with which the decay of
Spanish poetry in the age of Rebolledo is beheld,
yields to the agreeable surprize which arises on taking
a retrospective view of the Spanish drama, the history
of which must now be continued to the close of the
present period. The history of the Spanish drama
should properly be studied as a whole; but that combined
mode of viewing the subject was not compatible
with a synchronous account of all the remarkable productions
of the polite literature of Spain. Having,
however, in connexion with Lope de Vega, spoken of
Virues, Montalvan, and others, it will, at least, be convenient
not to separate the series of dramatic poets,
who emulated or imitated Calderon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span></p>

<h3 id="CALDERON">CALDERON.</h3>

<p>Again, in the history of Spanish poetry a writer
occurs, whose name deserves to be transmitted to the
latest posterity, and who flourished along with others
who are also worthy of honourable remembrance.</p>

<p>Pedro Calderon de la Barca, descended of a noble
family, was born in the year 1600. He is said to have
written his first dramatic work before he had completed
his fourteenth year. Having finished his collegial studies
at an early age, he, according to the custom of the times,
attached himself to some patrons whom he found among
the nobility at the court of Madrid. Not satisfied, however,
with this means of introducing himself to the great
world, he became a soldier, and served in several campaigns
in Italy and the Netherlands. Meanwhile the fame
of his talents as a dramatic poet was widely spread; and
it was foretold that he would equal, if not exceed, Lope
de Vega. King Philip IV. who afforded more liberal
encouragement to the drama than any of his predecessors,
and who was himself the author of several
plays, was gratified by the idea that he had in Calderon
a man capable of giving splendour to the court theatre.
He called him to Madrid in the year 1636, and shortly
after invested him with the order of St. Iago. From
this period Calderon became permanently fixed at court,
and his young sovereign, whose chief attention was
devoted to amusements and festivities, kept him in
constant activity. No expence was spared in bestowing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
pomp and brilliancy on the pieces which Calderon produced
for the entertainment of the court; but on the
other hand, it was expected of him to accommodate his
genius to the conditions required by a courtly audience.
Nevertheless his taste was consulted in the arrangement
of all public festivities, and the triumphal arch through
which the Queen Maria of Austria made her public
entrance into Spain, was erected in conformity with his
suggestions.</p>

<p>In his fifty-second year Calderon took holy orders,
but did not on that account totally relinquish his
previous occupations. From that time, however, he
applied himself with more particular assiduity to the
composition of his <i>Autos Sacramentales</i>, which soon
superseded throughout the whole of Spain all the older
dramas of this class. Calderon lived to an advanced
age, admired by his countrymen, and amply rewarded
by ecclesiastical dignities, pensions and presents, from
his sovereign. In the estimation of the public, his
dramas surpassed those of every preceding and contemporary
writer. But in his old age, he himself
attached but little importance to his temporal productions.
The Duke of Veragua addressed to him a
flattering letter, requesting to be furnished with a
complete list of his dramas, because the booksellers
were in the habit of selling the works of other writers
under his name. In reply, Calderon, who was then in
his eightieth year, supplied the duke only with the list
of his <i>Autos Sacramentales</i>. He added in a letter, that
with regard to his temporal dramas, he felt offended,
that in addition to his own faulty works, those of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
other authors should be circulated in his name; and
besides that, his writings were so altered that he himself
could not recognize even their titles. He also expressed
his determination to follow the example of the booksellers,
and to pay as little regard to his plays as they
did; but he observed, that on religious grounds he attached
more importance to his Autos.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a></p>

<p>Calderon died in 1687, in the eighty-seventh year
of his age. Several collections of his dramas appeared
during his life, and among the rest one published by his
brother, Joseph Calderon, in 1640, but none were edited
by the author himself. In the great edition of the collected
comedies of Calderon, which his friend Juan de
Vera Tassis y Villaroel began to superintend in 1685,
the poet, who was then eighty-five years of age, can
scarcely be expected to have indirectly participated even
so far as was necessary to certify the authenticity of the
component parts. It is therefore questionable whether
the hundred and twenty-seven plays, published in Calderon’s
name, be all genuine. This doubt may indeed
be hazarded with the greater probability, as Juan de
Vera Tassis, who undertook to publish the complete
collection of Calderon’s dramas, estimates the number
of his Autos at ninety-five; while Calderon himself,
in his conscientious list furnished to the Duke of
Veragua, states their number to be only sixty-eight, including
those not printed. It can scarcely be believed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
that Calderon wrote twenty-seven Autos after he had
attained the age of eighty.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a></p>

<p id="CHARACTER_OF_THE_DIFFERENT_SPECIES">On a comparison of the dramas of Calderon and
Lope de Vega, it requires no extraordinary critical
penetration to discover the essential services which the
former rendered to the dramatic literature of Spain.
Which of these writers possessed the greater share of
inventive talent, is a question which it would be difficult
to determine, for Lope de Vega was not the inventor
of that species of dramatic composition which
was common to both, and Calderon was not behind
him in the invention of new combinations of intrigue,
ingenious complexities of plot, and interesting situations.
In general the invention of Lope may be the
bolder, but it is also the more rude of the two; and with
regard to whatever may be called refinement, whether
in conception or execution, but more particularly in
style, Calderon formed for himself an entirely new
sphere. The delicate art with which he gave the last
polish to the Spanish drama, without changing its
nature, carries with it an ennobling dignity in some
of his historical, or, as they are styled, heroic comedies.
In his comedies of intrigue this delicacy is conspicuous
in the execution of the general forms of character,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
which had now become naturalized on the Spanish
stage, and which usurped the place of individuality.
Calderon’s comedies are necessarily as little pieces of
character as those of Lope de Vega, for with the
delineation of particular character they would have
ceased to be pure dramas of intrigue. But they abound
in characteristic traits, in those traits which develope,
as it were, out of the souls of the dramatic personages,
the natural course of the gay intrigue in all its various
modifications. As an acute observer of the female
mind and manners Calderon was infinitely superior to
Lope de Vega. This delicacy of observation accords
admirably with the almost incredible subtlety of his
combinations of intrigue; and the elegance of his language
and versification complete the ingenious harmony
of these apparently irregular dramas, which though
not sufficiently perfect to be regarded as models, are
nevertheless true to the rules which the author prescribed
to himself. The other merits which belong to
his dramas, such as the seductive gracefulness and facility
of the dialogue, Calderon shares in common with
all the good dramatic writers of Spain. The faults
with which he may be reproached, and which in some
measure belong to the species of drama he adopted,
are more numerous in some of his pieces than in others.
It must also be observed, that in some of his heroic
comedies, he sinks so completely beneath his own
standard that it is difficult to recognize him.</p>

<p>In Calderon’s <i>Comedias de Capa y Espada</i>,<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> the
plots are usually of so complicated a nature, that no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
reader except a Spaniard, habituated to this sort of
mental exercise,<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> can on a first perusal seize and follow
the various threads of the intrigue, by the artful entanglement
of which the principal characters of the
piece are repeatedly plunged from one unexpected
embarrassment into another. Calderon particularly
excelled in the accumulation of surprises, in connecting
one difficult situation with another, and in maintaining
undiminished the strongly excited interest to the close
of the piece. But in order to render this task the
easier, he paid still less attention than Lope de Vega
to probability in the succession of the scenes; and
his characters make their entries and their exits just
as it happens to suit the convenience of the poet. The
Spanish public was, however, disposed to pardon every
improbability of this kind, which gave rise to some
new situation full of dramatic truth. Calderon appears
to have estimated the merits of his dramas of intrigue,
in proportion to the effect produced by the situations;
and in this respect he was the more an inventor in
proportion as he introduced the less variety into his
characters. In all Calderon’s comedies of intrigue,
the dramatis personæ are the same individuals under
various names. Two or three ladies of fashion, two or
three lovers, an old man, a few waiting maids, a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
male servants, and among these last, one who acts as
the <i>gracioso</i>, or buffoon; such are the standing characters
with which Calderon usually contented himself
in his sphere of dramatic composition. The motives
on which the plot turns are a licentious gallantry, in
which no moral interest is permitted to mix, and a
point of honour which gives rise to incessant contests.
On the slightest cause of offence swords are drawn, and
when passion rages, even daggers are employed. Romantic
accessaries are found in wounds, and murders,
though the latter, it is true, are not quite so frequent as
the former. Among the other passions the fury of
jealousy is conspicuous; and in order to bring this passion
into play, the author avails himself of disguises,
concealments, mistakes of persons, houses or letters, and
occasionally some particular local circumstance, such
for instance, as the secret door, which appears to be a
cupboard, in the lively drama of <i>La Dama Duende</i>,
(The Fairy Lady.) There is also no want of night
scenes in Calderon’s pieces of intrigue. But however
astonishing may be the variety of the situations which
he has created out of this uniformity of plan, yet they
cannot long satisfy a cultivated taste which requires a
nobler kind of variety.</p>

<p>How far Calderon in his <i>Comedias de Capa y
Espada</i> has correctly represented the fashionable world
of Madrid, as it existed in the reigns of Philip III. and
Philip IV. is a question which cannot now be satisfactorily
determined. Modern Spanish writers have conceived
they were pronouncing a judicious critical censure,
when they cast on Calderon’s dramas the reproach of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
insulting the whole Spanish nation, by representing it
as composed almost solely of romantic coxcombs and
intriguing coquettes. These attacks on Calderon, are
the consequence of inconsiderate zeal for the principles
of the French drama, by which the dramatic literature
of Spain must never be judged.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> It is scarcely necessary
to observe, that a representation of one class of
men, who were particularly conspicuous in Madrid,
could not be intended as a representation of the whole
Spanish nation. But attempts have been made to
depreciate, by still more plausible sophisms, the merits
of Calderon’s sketches of manners. It has been remarked,
that he has totally violated nature, by putting
into the mouths of valets and waiting women poetic
language, which would be extraordinary even if delivered
by their masters and mistresses. The Spanish
servants of the present day are, doubtless, less likely
than those of the seventeenth century, to converse in
the poetical style in which the servants in Calderon’s
plays, on particular occasions, express themselves. But
the spirit of these particular occasions must not be
misunderstood. The servants in Calderon’s comedies
always imitate the language of their masters. In most
cases they express themselves like the latter, in the
natural language of real life, and often divested of that
colouring of the ideas, without which a dramatic work
ceases to be a poem. But whenever romantic gallantry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
speaks in the language of tenderness, admiration, or
flattery, then, according to Spanish custom, every idea
becomes a metaphor; and Calderon, who was a thorough
Spaniard, seized these opportunities to give the reins
to his fancy, and to suffer it to take a bold lyric flight
beyond the boundaries of nature. On such occasions the
most extravagant metaphoric language, in the style of
the Italian Marinists, did not appear unnatural to a Spanish
audience; and even Calderon himself had for that
style a particular fondness, to the gratification of which
he sacrificed a chaster taste. It was his ambition to become
a more refined Lope de Vega, or a Spanish Marino.
Thus in his play, entitled, <i>Bien vengas Mal, si vengas
Solo</i>, (Misfortune comes Well, if it comes Alone), a waiting
maid, addressing her young mistress who has risen
in a gay humour, says&mdash;“Aurora would not have done
wrong had she slumbered that morning in her snowy
chrystal, for that the light of her mistress’s charms
would suffice to draw aside the curtains from the couch
of Sol.” She adds that, using a Spanish idea, “it might
then indeed be said that the sun had risen in her lady’s
eyes,”<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> &amp;c. Valets, on the like occasion, speak in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
same style; and when lovers address compliments to
their mistresses, and these reply in the same strain, the
play of far-fetched metaphors is aggravated by antitheses
to a degree which is intolerable to any but a
Spanish formed taste.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> But it must not be forgotten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
that this language of gallantry was in Calderon’s time
spoken by the fashionable world, and that it was a
vernacular property of the ancient national poetry.</p>

<p>Faults of a less pardonable nature in Calderon’s
dramas, are the stale jests and meaningless plays on
words uttered by servants,<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> and the burlesque situations
to which the disgusting accidents, occasioned by certain
nocturnal showers from windows give rise. But according
to the testimony of travellers, such accidents
are very common at night in the streets of Madrid and
Lisbon; and it must be recollected that in Calderon’s
time the jests of servants were considered as indispensable
in a Spanish drama of intrigue, as the presence
of the <i>gracioso</i> himself, who is, for the most part, one
of the valets.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span></p>

<p>But the violations of cultivated taste which occur in
Calderon’s comedies of intrigue, are so amply redeemed,
that the critic cannot long hesitate to decide whether
faults or beauties are most abundant. Some of these
dramas are particularly remarkable for those descriptive
narratives, by the introduction of which nearly all the
Spanish comedies of the same class bring to recollection
their original relationship with novels.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> Though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
individual character is wanting, yet sometimes in the
course of the intrigue, beautiful characteristic traits
unexpectedly occur.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> The delicacy of the point of
honour, which in all these dramas supplies the place of
morality, is frequently exhibited by Calderon in its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
most brilliant point of view;<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> and he sometimes with
much formality oversteps the Spanish rule, by which
moralizing was excluded from this species of drama.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a>
The application which may be made of the plot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
is frequently denoted by the title of the piece, and is still
more distinctly developed at the conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> Calderon
deserves praise for having but seldom introduced sonnets
in his comedies of intrigue, though he has amply availed
himself of other freedoms, in order to maintain the privilege
of poetry in pourtraying the scenes of common
life.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a></p>

<p>Calderon’s heroic comedies are much diversified in
their kind, and very unequal in their merits. Some are
distinguished from the dramas of intrigue only by the
rank of the characters. Of this kind is the well known
piece, entitled, <i>El Secreto a Voces</i>, (the Published Secret),
imitations of which have appeared in the Italian, French,
and German languages. The Spaniards number it among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
their heroic comedies, merely because an Italian prince
and princess are introduced in it. Other plays by Calderon,
which, according to the Spanish nomenclature, are
ranked in the heroic class, are in fact romantic pastoral
dramas; as for example, the pleasing piece, entitled, <i>Eco
y Narciso</i>. Others again are romantic, mythological
festival pieces, accompanied by transformations and
melo-dramatic splendour; of this kind is <i>El mayor
encanto Amor</i>, (Love is the greatest Enchantment).
Finally, among Calderon’s heroic comedies are included
his historical dramas, several of which may
properly be called tragedies. Some of these historical
dramas are among the best, while others are the most
trivial of Calderon’s productions. All are melo-dramatic
spectacles, in which armies defile, battles are fought, and
sumptuous banquets are given. The scene is, by turns,
a palace, a vast landscape, a cavern, or a pleasure
garden, while drums and trumpets flourish, and cannon
thunder at every opportunity.</p>

<p>In all that regards scenic splendour in the composition
of historical plays, even Lope de Vega must
yield to Calderon, for the dramas of the latter were
represented at the expence of the royal treasury. But
in the historical style of dramatic composition Calderon
only succeeded when he selected his materials from the
events of his own country. Where he has adapted
to the Spanish stage, subjects from the Greek and
Roman history, as in his Alexander the Great,<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
his Coriolanus,<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> the absurd change of costume is almost
forgotten amidst the extravagant confusion of the events,
by which romantic situations are brought about one after
another, but which, on the whole, produce only a mean
effect. The great poet seems occasionally to have been
forsaken by his good genius, particularly when he makes
a display of his erudition in the very same scenes in
which he completely perverts ancient history. But Calderon’s
historical dramas of this class are very inferior
to those of which the story was invented by himself,
and the scene arbitrarily laid in ancient Greece.
Among the latter is a piece, entitled, <i>Finezas contra
Finezas</i>, (Generosity for Generosity), a beautiful poem,
full of tenderness and mythological piety. But this
drama, though, perhaps, single in its kind, must nevertheless
yield to the christian drama, of which the
history of Portugal furnishes the hero. The tragedy
of Don Fernando, entitled, <i>El Principe Constante</i>,
displays all the lustre of Calderon’s genius. The unities
of time and place are lost sight of in the unity of the
heroic action, into which Calderon has infused the spirit
of the purest pathos, without departing from the Spanish
national style of heroic comedy. This tragedy might
not improperly be named the Portuguese Regulus. Don
Fernando, a Portuguese prince, lands at the head of an
army, accompanied by his brother Don Enrique, on
the coast of Barbary in Morocco. He is victorious in
his first battle, and he makes prisoner the African hero,
Muley, who relates to him his history. The prince,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
moved by generosity, liberates his captive. No sooner
has Muley expressed his surprise and gratitude, than the
Moors return with a reinforcement, and the Portuguese
prince is himself made prisoner. At this point commence
the tragic scenes which are prepared by pathetic
situations of another kind. The king of Fez and
Morocco immediately offers liberty to his royal prisoner,
on condition of the surrender of the garrison of Ceuta
on the coast of Morocco, which is in possession of the
Portuguese. The prince declares that he would rather
die in the most degrading captivity, than consent to
obtain his freedom by delivering a christian town into
the power of the infidels. The moorish king, however,
relies so confidently on the acquisition of Ceuta, that
he treats the prince with every mark of respect until
the return of the envoy from Portugal. The answer
of the Portuguese government proves to be, as the king
of Fez expected, a compliance with his proposal; but
the prince firmly refuses to be ransomed on the required
condition. He now receives the most rigorous treatment,
which he bears with pious heroism and without complaint,
until his bodily strength is exhausted and he
expires. The sufferings and fortitude of Fernando;&mdash;the
conflict between gratitude and religious prejudice
in the mind of Muley, who exerts his utmost endeavours
to deliver the captive prince;&mdash;and, on the other hand,
Muley’s romantic passion for the king’s daughter, who is
destined to be the bride of another;&mdash;and the still more
romantic tenderness of the princess,&mdash;form altogether a
picture so noble and so truly poetic, that it would be
unfair in this brief sketch of the piece, to notice the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
numerous errors which it unquestionably presents. The
action seems to terminate with the death of Fernando;
but a fresh army arrives from Portugal, and the ghost
of the prince, with a torch in his hand, appears at the
head of the troops and leads them on to victory. The
impression produced by this apparition gives the finishing
touch to the romantic pathos of the foregoing scenes.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a>
The beautiful flights of fancy which occur at the commencement
of the piece are worthy of particular

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
of this tragedy would carry us beyond the limits of
this work.</p>

<p>Calderon’s <i>Autos Sacramentales</i> may be noticed in
a few words. In this class of dramatic composition,
Calderon pursued the path which had been previously
trodden by Perez de Montalvan, but he left his model
far behind him. Some of his autos, of which that
entitled, <i>La Devocion de la Cruz</i>, (the Miracles of the
Cross, or literally the Devotion of the Cross), may be
cited as an example, are the grandest and most ingenious
productions of the kind in the Spanish language. But
in these spiritual dramas, reason and moral feeling are
so perverted by extravagant and fantastic notions of
religious faith, that it is impossible to forbear congratulating
those nations whose better fate has excluded
them from amusements of this kind.</p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_OF_THE_SPANISH_DRAMA">HISTORY OF THE SPANISH DRAMA CONTINUED TO
THE CLOSE OF THE PERIOD OF THIS SECTION.</h3>

<p>Never, perhaps, was any dramatic poet accompanied
in so long a career by such a number of rivals, friends,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
and imitators, as Calderon. It was precisely the half
century during which he indefatigably laboured for the
Spanish theatre that gave birth to the greater part
of those dramas, the number of which is better known
than the merits. In consequence of the popularity
of Lope de Vega and Calderon, the passion for dramatic
composition became as epidemic in Spain as that of
sonnet writing had formerly been. The encouragement
which Philip IV. gave to the drama, doubtless contributed
not a little to excite this poetic emulation. But the
multitude of writers who entered into the competition
were ambitious of rivalling Lope de Vega and Calderon
in proofs of fertility of invention. The fecundity of
Perez de Montalvan, who, notwithstanding his life was
short, wrote nearly one hundred plays in the style of
Lope de Vega, was not allowed to remain a solitary
example. The impression produced by successive
<i>comedias famosas</i> on a public whose greatest mental
enjoyment was found in the theatre, was also felt by
those who were desirous of producing similar works.
Thus every piece which was applauded sowed the
seeds of new comedies. No author thought it necessary
to reform the principles on which Spanish comedy
was composed, or attempted to distinguish himself by
any particular originality. At the same time the spirit
which governed this emulation was equally remote from
an intentional imitation of the more celebrated dramatic
poets. He who was ambitious of adding one more to
the numberless dramas in the possession of the stage,
followed in the general stream under the influence of
impressions previously received. To wit and fancy free
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
scope was allowed; but any original traits which the
new production might contain, were more or less overshadowed
by the general character of this class of composition.
The whole of those dramatists, whose works
so closely resemble each other, form therefore only one
school. Were not the critic assisted by names the
most extensive, knowledge of this department of Spanish
literature would in most cases be insufficient to
enable him to distinguish the labours of different
authors. It often happened that several writers formed
a co-partnership of their talents for the production of
one piece. Hence arose the practice of printing on the
titles of some dramas, the words, “by two wits,” or
“by three wits,” (<i>de dos ingenios</i>, or <i>de tres ingenios</i>.)
Of the numerous aspirants in this conflict of efforts
and of talents, proportionally few succeeded in obtaining
a celebrity which entitles them to be placed near
Lope de Vega and Calderon. These few, however,
whose number, compared with the approved dramatists
of other nations, the French comic authors excepted,
is still very considerable, vied in ingenuity and delicacy
of composition with Calderon, and endeavoured to surpass
him in regularity.</p>

<p>Several authors have with much labour endeavoured
to discover the number of the Spanish dramas, as if
the knowledge of their amount even correctly ascertained,
could be worth the pains necessary to acquire it.
Of the three thousand eight hundred and fifty-two
dramatic works which La Huerta has enumerated,<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
the greater part belongs to the age of Calderon. Those
which Calderon himself wrote, appear in the list; and
it also includes a considerable number of short interludes,
some of which, perhaps, did not cost their authors
more than a few hours labour. But this list contains
only the printed dramas known to literary collectors.
That the number of pieces remaining in manuscript is
much greater, may from analogy be presumed; for of
the dramatic compositions of the idolized Lope de
Vega, which are estimated at more than two thousand,
not many more than three hundred have been printed.</p>

<p>It would not be uninteresting to analyze, for the
purpose of comparison with the works of Calderon,
some of the best of the other dramas of this age; but
such details do not fall within the province of this General
History of Spanish Poetry and Eloquence. Some
of the contemporaries of Calderon, however, vied with
him in so distinguished a manner, that an express but
brief notice of their merits becomes indispensable.</p>

<h3 class="hang" id="ANTONIO_DE_SOLIS">ANTONIO DE SOLIS&mdash;MORETO&mdash;JUAN DE HOZ&mdash;TIRSO
DE MOLINA&mdash;FRANCISCO DE ROXAS&mdash;AUGUSTIN
DE SALAZAR&mdash;MIRA DE MESCUA, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>An honourable station, beside Calderon, belongs to
Antonio de Solis, one of the most eminent authors of
his age. He was ten years younger than Calderon,
whom he survived a few years. His literary activity
was not limited to the study of poetry; for morals,
politics, and history, also occupied his attention, particularly
in his maturer years. He wrote the preludes,
(<i>loas</i>), to some of Calderon’s dramas, and appears to
have been connected by the ties of friendship with that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
great poet. The fame of his political and historical
knowledge obtained for him a place in the administration
under Philip IV. and after the death of that
monarch he was appointed to the lucrative post of
<i>Coronista de las Indias</i>, or historiographer of the transactions
of the Spaniards in both Indies. While he
held this office, he wrote his celebrated History of the
Conquest of Mexico, which will be more particularly
noticed at the close of the present book. Finally, he
entered into holy orders, and devoted himself almost
exclusively to exercises of devotion; he died in 1686.
His plays do not display so much boldness of imagination
as Calderon’s; but they are ingeniously composed
in the Spanish national style of intrigue, and exhibit an
elegant vivacity of diction. With regard to pleasantries
put into the mouths of servants, he does not exactly
correspond with other Spanish dramatists. His dramatic
compositions are more regular than Calderon’s, because
he was less liable to be seduced by the force of his
imagination. Among his comedies attributed to the
heroic class, <i>El Alcazar del Secreto</i>, (the Castle of
Mystery), is justly much valued. In his dramas of
intrigue he has endeavoured to vary the characters
more than his great contemporary. Thus gipseys figure
in his piece, called, <i>La Gitanilla de Madrid</i>, which is
partly founded on Cervantes’s novel of the same title.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span></p>

<p id="MORETO">Augustin Moreto possessed a higher degree of comic
talent than Calderon. This able and industrious writer
was also favoured by Philip IV. but he became an ecclesiastic
and renounced writing for the theatre. Some of
his pieces are comic from beginning to end, and are also
comedies of character, though the form of the Spanish
drama of intrigue is still preserved. In his piece, entitled,
<i>De fuera vendra, quien de casa nos eschara</i>,<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a>
(He will come from without, Who will turn us out), he
has introduced an old coquette, a military coxcomb, and a
doctor of laws, who besides being cowardly and pedantic,
is also amorous. These characters are drawn with a
comic force which has seldom been surpassed, though
it must be confessed that they partake too much of
the caricature style. In general Moreto approximates
more than Calderon to Terence, whose comedies became,
in the sequel, models for the Spanish dramatists when
the principles of the French drama were adopted. But
his <i>gracioso</i>, who is always the fool of the piece in the
character of a servant, repeats too often the same sort
of wretched jests.</p>

<p id="JUAN_DE_HOZ">Juan de Hoz likewise approached to the comic style
of the regular dramas representing character. Of this
author nothing further is known, except that he wrote
an excellent comedy, entitled, <i>El castigo de la Miseria</i>,
(Avarice Punished,) which presents a considerable resemblance
to one of Cervantes’s novels.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span></p>

<p id="TIRSO_DE_MOLINA">Tirso de Molina, or Gabriel Sellez, (as his real
name is said to have been) was one of the most prolific
dramatic writers among the contemporaries of
Calderon. He is the reputed author of upwards of
seventy plays still extant. He vied with Lope de
Vega and Calderon in the merit of ingenious and bold
invention, which is particularly manifested in his historical
and spiritual dramas.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a></p>

<p id="FRANCISCO_DE_ROXAS">The dramas of intrigue by Francisco de Rojas, or
Roxas, a knight of the order of Santiago, were, about
the middle of the sixteenth century, as much esteemed
as those of Calderon; for the art of ingenious complexity
which they exhibited, rendered them particularly pleasing
to the Spanish taste. A play by this author, entitled,
<i>Entre Bobos anda el Juego</i><a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a>, (When Fools play
the Game goes well), is even at the present day a distinguished
favourite on the Spanish stage. He was not
so successful as a writer of heroic comedies. His
<i>Casarse para Vengarse</i>, (Marriage of Vengeance),
which is a sort of tragedy, is disgustingly surcharged
with bombastic phrases.</p>

<p id="AGUSTIN_DE_SALAZAR_Y_TORRES">Agustin de Salazar y Torres, was educated in
Mexico, and after his return to Spain, lived at the
court of Philip IV. He was an admirer of Gongora,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
and as many of his poems prove, also a faithful disciple;
but though an inveterate Gongorist, he was one of the
cleverest writers of that school of affectation. His
dramatic works are distinguished for ingenuity of invention,
and a style which shews that he knew how
to elevate himself above the common level, without
running into bombast.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> His heroic comedy, entitled,
<i>Elegir al Enemigo</i>, (How to choose an Enemy), is
full of genuine poetry.</p>

<p id="MIRA_DE_MESCUA">Antonio Mira de Mescua, or Amescua, who lived
as an ecclesiastic at the court of Philip IV. must not
be omitted in the list of the Spanish dramatic poets of
the period now under consideration. He was regarded
by many of his contemporaries as a second Lope de
Vega;<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> and he doubtless more nearly approached the
rude brilliancy of Lope than the elegant manner of
Calderon. He remained, however, far behind his model;
yet his historical and spiritual dramas are distinguished
for conceptions, which, though extravagant, are not
devoid of interest, and which were moreover perfectly in
unison with the prevailing Spanish taste. In <i>El Caballero
sin Nombre</i>, (The Knight without a Name), he has
even ventured to introduce a wild bear on the stage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span></p>

<p id="COLLECTIONS_OF_SPANISH_DRAMAS">To the historian who makes the dramatic literature
of Spain his particular object, must be consigned the
task of collecting the necessary information respecting
the works of Antonio de Mendoza, Luis Velez de
Guevara, Alvaro Cubillo, Luis Coello, Felipe Godinez,
Juan Matos Fragoso, and other dramatists, who in the
age in which they lived, were frequently placed on a
level with Calderon. The writer who devotes his
attention to this department of Spanish literature, must
likewise take into consideration the older dramatic
works which appeared during the latter years of Lope
de Vega’s career, as, for example, the comedies of Juan
Ruiz de Alarcon, Guillen de Castro, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> Neither
must he neglect to furnish bibliographic accounts of
the various collections of Spanish dramas published by
different editors. In the present work it is only
necessary to observe, that these collections, the greater
part of which appeared in the seventeenth century,
were all speculations of the booksellers. Most of them
present abundant traces of haste and negligence, and but
few are distinguished for critical discrimination in the
selection. The historian of the Spanish national taste
will, however, consult those collections with the view
of ascertaining what dramas were, at a certain period,
the greatest favourites in Spain; for the booksellers
published their collections in conformity with the
humour of the public. Thus every drama which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
printed, was styled a <i>Comedia famosa</i>, so that about
the middle of the seventeenth century, the epithet
<i>famosa</i>, had, by frequent repetition, lost all value.</p>

<h3 class="hang" id="CONCLUSION_OF_THE_HISTORY_OF_SPANISH_ELOQUENCE">CONCLUSION OF THE HISTORY OF SPANISH ELOQUENCE
AND CRITICISM WITHIN THE PERIOD
OF THIS SECTION.</h3>

<p>The works belonging to the department of elegant
prose, which appeared during the period of the ascendency
of dramatic poetry in Spanish literature, may be
noticed in few words. The authors who still adhered
to the spirit of genuine eloquence, gave no new direction
to rhetorical cultivation; they merely continued,
with laudable perseverance, the task begun by their
predecessors, namely, that of opposing the party who
methodically endeavoured to introduce into prose composition
a new tone of ingenious absurdity.</p>

<p>Romantic prose no longer maintained a conflict
with true eloquence, but proceeded in a separate
course. The reading portion of the Spanish public
continued to be supplied with romances and novels,
most of which, however, were the production of obscure
writers. Several Spanish ladies contributed their
share in this kind of authorship.</p>

<p id="ANTONIO_DE_SOLIS_CONSIDERED_AS_A_HISTORIAN">The necessary distinction between historical and
romantic narrative was now made by the historiographers
or chroniclers, whose numbers had been
augmented since the extension of the Spanish possessions
in India and America. But among all these
writers, Antonio de Solis, who has already been noticed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
as a dramatic poet, is the only one who produced a
work deserving to be ranked among the models of
historical composition. His history, which he wrote in
the quality of historiographer of the Indies, is the last
classic relic of the kind of which Spanish literature can
boast. It contains an account of the Conquest of
Mexico, in a genuine historical form, notwithstanding
that the subject was calculated to seduce a poetic author
into the romantic narrative style.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> Those who are
unacquainted with the fact of Antonio de Solis being
a celebrated poet, will never conjecture it from the
general tone of this work. No writer could possibly
mark with more solidity of taste the distinction between
poetry and prose. Antonio de Solis had, however,
attained the age of maturity when he laid down the
principles by which he was guided in the discharge of
his functions as a historian. He states in his preface
that in history all ornaments of eloquence are merely
accessaries; and that the accuracy of the relation is
true historical elegance. He says, that truth must be
of all things the most important to the historian, and
that in historical composition what is truly stated, is well
stated.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> According to these principles the very worst
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
style possible would be tolerable in a faithful historical
narrative. But it would appear that Antonio de Solis,
through a distrust of his own poetic imagination,
exaggerated to himself the necessity of self-denial as
an homage due to historical fidelity; and this exaggeration,
which in reality was only theoretical, proved of
essential service to him in the execution of his work. His
talent for description, and his cultivated taste, naturally
elevated him above the dryness and dulness of the
common chronicle style. Though he seems scarcely to
have reflected on the more essential requisites of the
historical art, yet his work has not suffered by their
neglect; for as a dramatic poet he had been accustomed
to an arrangement of events which concentrated them
in a single point of view; and profound political knowledge
was not required for the just exposition of
transactions occurring in the expedition of a small party
of Spanish adventurers, led on by the daring Hernando
Cortes, to the conquest of the kingdom of Mexico.
Nothing more was necessary than a simple and unaffected
narration, to cause the interest naturally belonging
to the subject to be strongly felt.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span></p>

<h3 id="INTRODUCTION_OF_GONGORISM">INTRODUCTION OF GONGORISM INTO SPANISH
PROSE&mdash;BALTHASAR GRACIAN.</h3>

<p>The elegant simplicity of the historical style adopted
by Antonio de Solis, forms, with the Gongorism which
about this time crept into Spanish prose composition
from the poetic school of Gongora, a rhetorical contrast,
which is the last remarkable phenomenon in the history
of Spanish eloquence. The pedantic commentators of
the unintelligible Gongora had long been accustomed to
write a strange fantastic prose style; but this prosaic
Gongorism had not infected any man of distinguished
talent, until Lorenzo, or Balthasar Gracian, became a
popular author. Writers on literature mention but few
particulars respecting the life of this distinguished man,
who is supposed to have died in the year 1652. It is probable
that he himself concealed his literary existence;
for it is conjectured that the works which on their title-pages
bear the name of Lorenzo Gracian, were really
written by Balthasar Gracian, who was a Jesuit, and the
brother of Lorenzo. Respecting Lorenzo nothing further
is known than that he is understood to have lent his name
to the productions of his brother; but, be this as it may,
the writings which have conferred celebrity on that name,
are, in some measure, sufficiently jesuitical.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> They relate,
in general, to the morality of the great world, to
theological morality, and to poetry and rhetoric. The
most voluminous of these works bears the affected title
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
of <i>El Criticon</i>. It is an allegorical picture of the whole
course of human life divided into <i>Crisis</i>, that is to say,
sections according to fixed points of view, and clothed
in the formal garb of a pompous romance. It is scarcely
possible to open any page of this book without recognizing
in the author a man, who is in many respects
far from common, but who from the ambition of being
entirely uncommon in thinking and writing studiously
and ingeniously, avoids nature and good sense. A
profusion of the most ambiguous subtleties, expressed
in ostentatious language, are scattered throughout the
work;<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> and those affected conceits are the more offensive,
in consequence of their union with the really
grand view of the essential relationship of man to
nature and his Creator, which forms the subject of the
treatise. Gracian would have been an excellent writer
had he not so anxiously wished to be an extraordinary
one. His shorter productions, in which he developes
his theory of the intellectual faculties, and the conduct
of life, are still more disfigured by affected ornament
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
than the tedious Criticon;<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> they, however, occasionally
contain striking observations intelligibly expressed.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a>
His <i>Oraculo Manual</i> has been more read than any
other of his works. It is intended to be a collection of
maxims of general utility, but it exhibits good and bad
precepts, sound judgments, and refined sophisms, all
confounded together. In this work Gracian has not
forgotten to inculcate the practical principle of jesuitism
“to be all things to all men,” (<i>hacerse a todos</i>), nor to
recommend his own favourite maxim, “to be common
in nothing,” (<i>en nada vulgar</i>), which in order to be
valid would require a totally different interpretation
from that which he has given it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span></p>

<p>Gracian’s <i>uncommon</i> prose was formed according to
certain principles. His book on the Art of Ingeniously
Thinking and Writing,<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> is no inconsiderable contribution
to criticism in Spanish literature. He refines to an
incredible degree on subtle distinctions and antitheses,
with the view of systematically bringing the style of
his countrymen to the level of his own. His illustrative
examples are selected from Italian and Spanish
poets, particularly from Marino, Gongora and Quevedo.
Throughout the whole work, ingenious thoughts (<i>conceptos</i>,)
are constantly the subject of consideration. A
man of genius, he says, may receive these ideas from
nature; but art enables him to create them at pleasure.
“As he who comprehends such ideas is an eagle, so he
who is capable of producing them must be ranked
among angels; for it is an employment of cherubims
and an elevation of man which raises him to sublime
hierarchy.”<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> He then proceeds to describe those <i>conceptos</i>,
which he pronounces to be undefinable, because
“they are to the understanding what beauty is to the
eye, and harmony to the ear.”<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> Next follows an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
enumeration and explanation of the numerous combinations
by which the various classes of these ideas, for
example, the proverbial, the pathetic, the heroic, &amp;c.
may be produced. Poetic figures are examined in
rotation; and the style of true eloquence is defined
according to the same principles. Thus throughout
the whole book good sense and good taste are most
ingeniously abused.</p>

<p>This art of poetry and rhetoric by Gracian was, in
the seventeenth century, the only work of the kind
which produced any influence on the taste of writers
and the public.</p>

<p>Gongorism peeps forth even in the published letters
of the eminent men of this period, which exhibit a
strained formality and an affected elegance. The
letters of Quevedo form in this respect no exception.
Even in those of Antonio de Solis the facility of the
true epistolatory style is wanting.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a>

<h3 id="HISTORY_OF_SPANISH_LITERATURE">HISTORY OF SPANISH LITERATURE FROM ITS DECLINE
IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH
TO THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY.</h3>

<p>This book is intended to be only a compendious
supplement to the two preceding books of the History
of Spanish Poetry and Eloquence. Were it even an
agreeable task to describe in detail through what gradations
a nation rich in intellect, which unfortunately
descended from the most brilliant height of literary
independence, to the servile imitation of foreign forms,
passed in this lamentable decline, until the depressed
national spirit began with patriotic feeling again to arise,
and slowly to re-animate the native literature&mdash;it still
would be proper to leave that office to the writer whose
object it may be to give an account of every production
which appears within the circle of polite learning. From
him, however, who has rather chosen to take a general
historical view of the developement and progress of literary
genius and taste in modern Europe, it would be
unreasonable to expect specific notices of inferior works,
published during the period of an expiring and slowly
reviving literature. In the eighteenth century, no poet
arose in Spain to form an epoch such as that finally
marked in Italian literature by Metastasio; and whatever
was then accomplished in Spanish prose, was a
consequence of the imitation of French models.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span></p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to observe, that according
to the laws of nature and the human mind, no distinct
line of separation can exist between this period and
that which precedes it. When lights are gradually and
imperceptibly extinguished, it is impossible to name the
moment when obscurity commenced. It would be no
less difficult to fix precisely the epoch of the revival of
Spanish literature, for it is marked by no particular
phenomenon. The necessary division in the history
of the progressive and retrogressive state of Spanish
literature must therefore be referred, without any precise
determination, to the reign of Charles II. from
1665 to 1700. Some dramatic authors who maintained
the respectability of the Spanish national theatre, to
the beginning of the eighteenth century, will consequently
be included in this last book. Thus the account
of the new dawn of national genius, promising better
times, will be given in connexion with the immediately
preceding literary transactions.</p>

<p>This book may be conveniently divided into three
chapters. The first will contain the history of the
complete decay of the Spanish national spirit in respect
to literature. In the second will be given a brief account
of whatever literary events appear to deserve consideration
from the reign of Charles II. to the commencement
of the reign of Charles III. The third chapter
will be devoted to a summary notice of the more recent
occurrences, which particularly in the last ten years of
the eighteenth century appear to have given a new direction
to Spanish literature.

<h3 id="GENERAL_VIEW_OF_THE_STATE_OF_POETICAL">GENERAL VIEW OF THE STATE OF POETICAL AND
RHETORICAL CULTIVATION IN SPAIN DURING
THIS PERIOD.</h3>

<p>Within the century composed of the reigns of the
three Philips, from 1556 to 1665, that is to say, the
golden age of Spanish literature, the national spirit,
which the vicious system of the government was calculated
to repress, became at last like the national
resources, completely exhausted. Under Charles II. the
wounds of the body politic which had long profusely bled,
began to exhibit frightful gangrenes. In every quarter
of the world Spanish valour had done its uttermost for
the support of the perverse measures of a despotic government,
and the state at length seemed on the verge
of dissolution. The enormous treasures which poured
into Spain from the mines of America, were immediately
consigned to foreign nations. Thus the richest
country in the world was overwhelmed with debt.
Agriculture and industry languished particularly in
the interior of the monarchy, where a near view of
the splendour of an ostentatious court still served to
gratify Castilian vanity, but where every blow levelled
against the whole state was most directly felt. The
occupation of one half of America carried off men from
the mother country by thousands at a time; and in
addition to this drain, the population had been suddenly
diminished to the extent of nearly half a million,
by the tyrannical expulsion of the Moriscos, or baptized
Arabs. Spain was also engaged in uninterrupted warfare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
during the whole of the century in which the three
Philips reigned. Continual levies of troops, combined
with oppressive taxation, at length so reduced the
nation, that the government lost the instrument it had
abused; and every sacrifice made to meet cases of imperious
urgency, served only to produce a new humiliation.
The little kingdom of Portugal, by a fortunate
effort threw off the Spanish yoke, and became once more
an independent state. Torrents of Spanish blood were
shed in the Netherlands, with the view of suppressing,
at any price, the freedom of the United Provinces; yet
those provinces flourished in full vigour, while Spain
was reduced to the last stage of political inanition.
Still, however, Spanish genius appeared to soar superior
to all the evils that assailed the state, as long, at least,
as the semblance of the ancient national greatness
remained. But with the death of Philip IV. even that
semblance vanished. The widowed queen, who was appointed
guardian of the young king, then only five years
of age, acting under the influence of father Neidhart, a
German Jesuit, offered the last insult to the feelings of the
nobility and the people. No sooner was father Neidhart
driven away by the party of Don John of Austria,
the natural son of Philip IV. than France obtained
possession of a considerable portion of the provinces
which Spain still held in the Netherlands. In the
West Indies a republic of pirates was established. This
new enemy grew out of the remarkable association of
the Flibustiers, or Buccaneers, men who regarded
Spanish America as a booty on which they were entitled
to prey. This state of things was not improved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
when the full powers of government were placed in
the hands of the weak Charles II. the period of whose
reign is the most melancholy in Spanish history.</p>

<p>The circumstance of a French prince being called
to the Spanish throne, in obedience to that will of
Charles II. which has been so much censured, was by
no means unfortunate for Spain, either in a literary or
political point of view. The war, which was partly a
civil contest, and which was maintained for twelve
years before the new Philip, the fifth of that name,
was tranquilly seated on his throne, seemed, however,
to threaten the annihilation of the last remnant of
Spanish national vigour. The mild and rigidly pious
Philip V. was, by his personal character and mode of
thinking, previously related to the nation to which he
now belonged. He manifested no desire to transplant
into Spain the literature of France, which at that time
began to exercise an influence over the whole of Europe.
The foreigners whose promotion to important
posts during the reign of the first Bourbon in Spain,
rendered them the objects of much patriotic jealousy,
were Italians and Irishmen, but in no instance Frenchmen.
The French influence operated in Spain, only
on the wavering politics of the cabinet of Madrid; the
change of the reigning dynasty produced therefore little
or no influence on Spanish literature. All that Philip
V. did to promote the advancement of learning on the
French model, was wholly confined to the celebrated
institution of royal academies, among which the
academy of history, and still more, the academy of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
the Spanish language and polite literature,<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> may be
regarded as having operated influentially on the literature
of Spain. But this last-mentioned academy,
which was established in the year 1714, was never
intended for the annihilation of the spirit and peculiar
forms of Spanish poetry and eloquence. The cultivation
of the Spanish language was its especial care, and
its labours for the accomplishment of that object were
crowned by the production of its excellent dictionary.
The efforts made by some members of this academy
to form the taste of their countrymen on the model of
that of France, must be attributed to themselves individually.
They merely followed the new current of
French taste, in common with almost every person in
Europe, who had then any pretensions to polite education.
If these innovators must be called a literary
court party, the term can only be employed in the
sense in which it would, with equal propriety, apply to
the same sort of party existing in other countries,
where the French style became the fashionable style
of courts, and was, with courtier-like complaisance,
generally adopted by authors both in verse and in
prose.</p>

<p>The French taste spontaneously penetrated into
Spanish literature when the age of Louis XIV. began
to exercise an imposing influence over the whole world.
But the French taste would have operated on the literature
of Spain, which had already been carried so far
beyond that of France, in a very different manner, had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
not the old national energy been crippled in every direction.
Had it not been for this unfortunate circumstance
crowds of servile imitators and pseudo critics would never
have obtained a footing in Spain. Men of rightly cultivated
understanding would have reconciled their purer
taste to the yet unexhausted national genius, in order
to enhance the advantages of Spanish literature in its
competition with the literature of France, and to learn
true elegance from the French, without, like them,
sacrificing to mere elegance beauties of a higher order.
But the age of vigour was past; and yet feeble pride
would in no respect renounce its pretensions. Two
parties now arose in the polite literature of Spain. The
leading and would-be elegant party, included persons
of rank and fashion, who had begun to be ashamed of
the ancient national literature, and who yet wished to
prove that that national literature, even when estimated
according to the rules of French criticism, possessed
many beauties. That the French might no longer boast
of superior taste, this party sought to improve Spanish
poetry, and particularly the Spanish drama, by translations
of French works and imitations of the French
style. To this party of fashionable innovators was
opposed the old national party, composed of persons
distinguished for their obstinate attachment to the
ancient taste, and even to the ancient rudeness. This
party continued, as heretofore, to be that of the Spanish
public; but it remained for a time without any literary
representative. Thus was it reduced to the necessity
of seeing writers, who laid claim to the title of Spanish
patriots, publicly attack its old favourites, particularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
Lope de Vega and Calderon, while no zealous pen took
up their public defence. Nevertheless this party continued
unshaken in its opinions. Even during the
extreme crisis of the conflict between the French and
the national taste, about the middle of the eighteenth
century, the Spanish theatre preserved its own peculiar
forms. It assumed, however, a character no less varied
than the German theatre at present exhibits. Plays in
the national style were performed on the Spanish stage
alternately with translations and imitations of French
and even of English dramas; and if this heterogeneous
variety did not degenerate into the monstrous, as it now
does on the German stage, where a national style never
prevailed, yet nothing could be more inconsistent than the
contrast formed by plays in the French and English taste
with the old Spanish comedies. But these comedies,
and in general all the old national poetry, once more
obtained spirited defenders among Spanish critics and
authors, after the shock of the last crisis had been
withstood by the ancient taste in its conflict with the
modern. Thus another literary triumph was gained by
the tenacity of the Spanish public, to which, in matters
of taste, monarchs otherwise despotic, readily granted
perfect freedom.</p>

<p>The mixture of national and foreign taste in the
modern literature of Spain, was promoted in no slight
degree by the introduction of French manners, which
had at this period spread over Europe, but which were
in Spain less encouraged by court example than in
other countries. At the court of Madrid, old Spanish
formality was still preserved; and among the nobility, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>
well as the people, the national costume was only
gradually superseded by the French style of dress.
Bull fights continued to be the favourite amusements
of the Spaniards from the highest to the lowest ranks.
But the solemn <i>Autos de Fe</i>,<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> in which the inquisition
appeared in all the splendour of its power, and in
which heretics were burnt amidst the approving shouts
of the spectators, no longer insulted humanity. The
last of these horrible festivals of fanaticism was performed
with extraordinary pomp at Madrid in the
year 1680, in compliance with the pious wish of King
Charles II. The Bourbons who succeeded to the Spanish
throne, whatever might be the ardour of their catholic
zeal, appeared to regard such barbarous spectacles
with disgust, and thus set an example of refinement
which honourably marked their relationship to the
French royal family. At this period, too, when the
storm of the reformation had subsided, religion as well
as manners assumed a milder character throughout all
Europe. The Spaniards, however, could not be induced
to renounce their sacred comedies, until in the year
1765 they were formally prohibited by a royal decree,
because they excited the derision of foreigners.</p>

<p>Finally, in the second half of the eighteenth century,
scientific learning gained an ascendancy over polite literature
in Spain, as in every other part of Europe. A
philosophy in the sense of the French encyclopædists
inflicted wounds equally mortal on fanaticism and poetic
enthusiasm. The spirit of experiment which sought by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>
an accumulation of facts to scan the furthest depths of
human knowledge and the principles of all science, and
styled that accumulation sound philosophy, had, since
the time of the French encyclopædists, found favour in
Spain, as in every part of Europe, Germany excepted.
True poetry, to which this spirit of experiment is the
most dangerous of all enemies, could not easily revive
in its former magnificence. But a wider field of general
utility was, under certain restrictions, opened to elegant
prose; and criticism at least obtained the negative
advantage of being able to impede any new encroachments
of ingenious extravagance.</p>

<h3 id="DECAY_OF_THE_OLD_SPANISH_POETRY">DECAY OF THE OLD SPANISH POETRY AND ELOQUENCE,
AND INTRODUCTION OF THE FRENCH
STYLE INTO SPANISH LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>The last branch of Spanish national poetry still
flourished in the reign of Charles II. The French
drama, which then appeared in the first dawn of its
celebrity, had as yet no influence on the drama of
Spain. Several assiduous writers continued to enrich
Spanish literature with new pieces in the manner of
Calderon; and these writers have here the first claim to
consideration.</p>

<h3 id="CANDAMO_ZAMORA_AND_CANIZARES">CANDAMO, ZAMORA, AND CAÑIZARES, DRAMATISTS
IN THE OLD NATIONAL STYLE.</h3>

<p>Towards the close of the seventeenth century, the
dramas of Francisco Bancas Cándamo, were particularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
esteemed. Cándamo, who was an Asturian of noble
extraction, received, during a certain period, a pension
from Charles II. for writing for the court theatre at
Madrid. He, however, died in indigence in the year
1709. His historical play, entitled, <i>El Esclavo en
Grillos de Oro</i>, (the Slave in Golden Fetters), is still
spoken of in terms of approbation in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> It is
a romantic anecdote taken from the history of the
Emperor Trajan. The singular combination of the
ancient and the romantic costume which this play
presents, is a fault with which the author must not be
reproached; for since Lope de Vega’s time the spirit of
the Spanish drama required that the events of ancient
history should be arrayed only in the garb of romance.
But Cándamo has put into the mouth of the Emperor
Trajan, a superabundance of phrases which are exceedingly
dull, though conveyed in light and harmonious
verse. The purely romantic scenes in which ladies
and young knights appear, are the best in this drama,
which, according to the Spanish classification is a heroic
comedy.</p>

<p>Antonio de Zamora, a gentleman belonging to the
court of Madrid, was particularly distinguished as a
writer of comic dramas. The comedy, entitled, <i>El
Hechizado por Fuerza</i>, (the Bewitched by Force),<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
one of the most humorous and regular in the Spanish
language. It may also be numbered among the dramas
of character; at least the two principal parts, though a
little overcharged, are nevertheless boldly conceived and
consistently maintained. One is a fantastic old man,
who continually expresses himself in a tone of sarcastic
comic humour:&mdash;he makes a parade of his odd fancies,
as if they were so many proofs of real wisdom; and he
is induced to consent to a marriage under the idea that
he is bewitched. The other comic character is an
enamoured physician, who is prevailed on to take a
part in the pretended bewitching, and who on his part is
also outwitted by the sprightly girls whom he has
assisted in playing off their trick on the old man.</p>

<p>Joseph de Cañizares, who likewise lived at the
court of Madrid, produced a considerable number of
Spanish comedies. He particularly devoted his attention
to that class of dramas of intrigue, called <i>comedias
de figuròn</i>, in which the principal character is a pretender
or braggadocio, either male or female, who by
dint of impudence and artifice, obtains a certain degree
of credit. Among the dramas of Cañizares, the Spaniards
particularly esteem his comedy, entitled, <i>El
Domine Lucas</i>;<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> it is a drama of character, comic
throughout, and of the most regular description, though
it by no means departs from the Spanish national style.
The title may be translated “The Pedant Squire;” for
Domine Lucas, the hero of the piece, is a young country
gentleman, a student of Salamanca, extremely dull and
affected, and withal proud of his noble birth. With this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>
character is very happily combined the uncle of Lucas,
a brave, amiable, and sensible old gentleman; though,
like his nephew, he interlards his discourse with scraps
of latin from the <i>Corpus Juris</i>. An old domestic, who
likewise has resource to latin whenever his wit fails
him, is well grouped with his master’s. An excellent
female pendant to the doltish hero is exhibited in the
character of one of the daughters of the old uncle,
who in the end is united to Lucas, while her sprightly
sister, to whom the Domine was betrothed, elopes with
a more agreeable lover. The traits of character in the
whole of this comic picture, though by no means delicately
sketched, are, nevertheless, full of dramatic
spirit.</p>

<p>These, and other plays, by writers whose names
are not in any other respect distinguished, complete
the national treasure of the Spanish drama. The
striking regularity which distinguishes some pieces,
must by no means be attributed to the influence of
French taste. It is possible that a vague idea of the
regularity of the French comedy may at this time have
penetrated into Spain; but among the older Spanish
dramas, particularly those of Solis and Moreto, some
are no less regular than the comedies of character
written by Zamora and Cañizares; who, besides, did
not always, any more than their predecessors, confine
themselves rigidly within the bounds of regularity.
In the works of these latter poets, the theatrical personages
are precisely of the same cast as in the writings
of the older dramatists. Young officers, who are usually
represented as giddy lovers, boast of their adventures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
in Flanders, and sing romances to the accompaniment
of the guitar. This part is the prototype of that which
on the French stage was subsequently called the <i>Chevalier</i>.
No trace of the imitation of French manners
is perceptible; and, if here and there a French word
is introduced, it is always with a comic signification.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a></p>

<h3 id="DONA_JUANA_INEZ_DE_LA_CRUZ">DOÑA JUANA INEZ DE LA CRUZ.</h3>

<p>Nothing poetical produced at this period, or at
least nothing sung and written in the lyric or other styles
of poetry in Spain, obtained literary celebrity. It would,
however, be unjust to pass over in silence some works
which made their appearance about this time, and
which are interesting, inasmuch as they afford instances
of the continuation of the taste for old Spanish poetry.
Among these, the most remarkable are the numerous
productions of a Spanish American poetess, named
Doña Juana Inez de la Cruz, who was much celebrated
in Mexico about the latter end of the seventeenth
century. On the title-page of her works, which, however,
she did not publish herself, this distinguished
woman is styled the tenth muse.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> Respecting the
history of her life, nothing is known, save what is mentioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
in her poems. She was a nun in a Mexican
convent; and she complains of her weak state of health
in the verses which form the preface to her poems. Her
writings sufficiently prove that she lived on terms of intimacy
with the viceroy and the other Spanish grandees
in Mexico, and that frequent demands were made upon
her talent for the celebration of festivals, both spiritual
and temporal. Much as Inez de la Cruz was deficient
in real cultivation, her productions are eminently superior
to the ordinary standard of female poetry. Of
all the Spanish ladies who have turned their attention
to poetry, she deserves to rank the highest; though, perhaps,
this station may not be deemed very honourable,
as Spanish women have so little distinguished themselves
in poetry. But for this very reason it seems
the more worthy of recollection, that under the sky
of America, flowers of genius were permitted to bloom,
which in Spain would in all probability have been
blighted in the bud. The poems of Inez de la Cruz,
moreover, breathe a sort of masculine spirit. This ingenious
nun possessed more fancy and wit than sentimental
enthusiasm; and whenever she began to invent,
her creations were on a bold and great scale. Her
poems are of very unequal merit; and are all deficient
in critical cultivation. But in facility of invention
and versification, Inez de la Cruz was not inferior to
Lope de Vega; and yet she by no means courted literary
fame. The complete collection of her poems,
which seems to have been first printed by order of
the Vice-Queen of Mexico, occupies a volume, consisting
of twenty-five sheets in octavo. Of some of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
sonnets the subjects are ingenious plays of romantic
wit;<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> of others, serious poetic reflections.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> She also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span>
wrote burlesque sonnets on rhymed endings, which,
though sometimes deficient in delicacy, have all the
freedom and sprightliness that can be required in that
species of composition. A kind of poetic self-deception,
which assumes the tone of philosophic reasoning, is disclosed
in several of the lyric romances of Inez de la Cruz.
She evidently took considerable pains to persuade herself
that she was happy.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> A great portion of her
poems in the romance style, relate to circumstances
of temporary interest. In her dramatic works, the
vigour of her imagination is particularly conspicuous.
The collection of her poems contains no comedies,
properly so called, but it comprises a series of boldly
conceived preludes, (<i>loas</i>), full of allegorical invention;
and it concludes with a long allegorical auto, which is
superior to any of the similar productions of Lope de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
Vega. It is entitled, <i>El Divino Narciso</i>, a name by
which the authoress designates the heavenly Bridegroom.
The Spanish public had never before witnessed
so bold a travesty of the ideas of catholic christianity,
under the garb of the Greek mythology. It
would be impossible to give a brief, and at the same
time intelligible sketch of this extraordinary drama.
With regard to composition it is quite monstrous; in
some respects offending by its bad taste, and in others
charming by its boldness. Many of the scenes are so
beautifully and romantically constructed, that the reader
is compelled to render homage to the genius of the
poetess; while at the same time he cannot but regret
the pitch of extravagance to which ideas really
poetic are carried. There is one peculiarly fine
scene in which human nature, in the shape of a
nymph, seeks her beloved, the real Narcissus, or the
christian Saviour. The imagination of the authoress
had, doubtless, been influenced by impressions received
from the Song of Solomon.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> Next to this grand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
Auto, the spiritual canciones in the old Spanish style,
and some cantatas deserve to be distinguished among
the works of Inez de la Cruz. They abound in sentimental
fancies, which, though generally extravagant,
often possess beauties which render them highly interesting;
and according to the notices in the collection,
they were all sung in the churches of Mexico. Some
latin compositions of the same class are inserted, which
seem also to have been written by Inez herself. The
writer who may undertake a history of the poetic developement
of the catholic faith, will find his advantage
in rendering himself intimately acquainted with these
poems.</p>

<h3 id="Gerardo_Lobo">GERARDO LOBO.</h3>

<p>In order to be satisfied that Spanish poetry inclined
very little to the French, in the early part of the eighteenth
century, it is only necessary to advert to the
continued influence of Gongorism at that period, as
exemplified in poetic productions, which are in other
respects too unimportant to claim any notice. Men
of rank in particular, who, following the honourable
example of their forefathers, continued to cultivate the
arts and sciences, seem to have regarded Gongorism as
the only style that was truly gentlemanly and worthy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
of their adoption. Accordingly Eugenio Gerardo Lobo,
who was a captain in the Spanish guards, and commandant
of the town and fortress of Barcelona, composed
in his leisure hours, many spiritual and temporal
poems in the manner of the Gongorists, which, since the
author’s decease, have been reprinted.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> A new edition
of these poems, which appeared in 1758, is inscribed by
the publisher to a miraculous image of the virgin, with
all the usual formality of a dedicatory epistle. In this
dedication the holy virgin, in quality of queen of heaven,
is addressed by the title of “Your Majesty.” Thus
in the middle of the eighteenth century, when an elegant
and learned party had long rendered homage to French
literature, the taste of the Spanish public could still
endure absurdities of this kind.</p>

<h3 id="Diffusion_of_the_French_taste">DIFFUSION OF THE FRENCH TASTE&mdash;LUZAN, HIS
ART OF POETRY, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>It was, however, in the commencement of the eighteenth
century that the French taste found its way into
the Spanish academy; and this circumstance, which
was not the effect of accident, serves to mark a kind
of epoch in the history of Spanish poetry.</p>

<p>Ignacio de Luzan, who has become the authority to
whom most Spanish critics refer, must be regarded as
the founder of the French school in Spanish literature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>
He was a member of the royal Spanish academy, a
member of the academy of history, an honorary member
of the academy of painting, sculpture, and architecture;
and at the same time counsellor of state and
minister of commerce. In addition to these dignities,
he was distinguished for extraordinary learning; and
he was in particular very deeply versed in ancient
literature. He studied with great assiduity Aristotle’s
Art of Poetry and Rhetoric, and also the rhetorical
works of Cicero. He was a lover of poetry, and composed
very elegant verses in his native tongue. Being,
as his writings sufficiently prove, a man of candid
and enlightened mind, national pride did not deter
him from making himself intimately acquainted with
French literature; and comparing it without prejudice,
under its best point of view, with the literature of his
own country. This was certainly a course altogether
new for a Spanish author.</p>

<p>In order to form a just estimate of the spirit of Luzan’s
labours, it is necessary to bear in mind that the theoretical
literature of Spain furnished him with scarcely
a single trace of sound criticism; that even those Spanish
poets who possessed the justest feeling for poetic beauty,
propounded, in their theoretic explanations, the most
erroneous notions on the value and the essence of poetry;
that only a critical tact, and an instinctive imitation
of good models, had preserved the most correct among the
Spanish poets from wanderings of the imagination and
perversions of judgment; and that in the age of Luzan,
the only art of criticism which was theoretically taught
in Spain, had issued from the school of Gongora, and was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
consequently only calculated to assist the systematic
propagation of absurdity and affectation. Moreover, the
elegant correctness of the French poets was, in that
age, calculated to dazzle by the charm of novelty.
Finally, the delicate subtleties whereby the principles
of French criticism and of French poetry, since the age
of Moliere and Corneille, were derived from the classic
school of antiquity, and the moral syllogisms with which
those principles were entrenched behind Aristotle’s Art
of Poetry, as their last bulwark, were well calculated
to seduce a man of Luzan’s erudition. His partiality
for the French school, and his efforts to reform
the Spanish taste according to the principles of that
school, are therefore no proofs of narrowness of mind,
though genuine poetic feeling certainly was not within
the sphere of his talent. He possessed a delicate sense
for elegance and the dress of poetry, but not for the energy
and loftiness of poetic genius. It is thus easy to
account for his having, with the best intentions, theoretically
misunderstood the essence and design of poetry;
and for his also having, in conformity with the spirit of
French criticism, confounded the objects of the poet
with the duties of the orator and the moralist.</p>

<p>It was then with the view of fundamentally
reforming the literary taste of his countrymen, that
Luzan wrote his celebrated Art of Poetry. It was
first published at Saragossa in the year 1737, in a
folio volume containing five hundred and three pages;<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
and it has ever since been the code to which Spanish
critics and authors have referred for the decision of all
cases of doubt. Sound judgment and classic erudition
are the chief characteristics of the work. The diction
too is simple and elegant, and prolixity is avoided,
though in order to attain that degree of perspicuity
which was necessary for subduing Spanish prejudice,
much detail was indispensable. Newly discovered
truths must not be looked for in Luzan’s Art of Poetry.
He even claims credit for the doctrines he developes
on account of their venerable antiquity. His theory is
declared by himself to be in the main no other than that
of Aristotle, the greatest of philosophers. To the neglect
of that theory he attributes the multitude of monstrous
excrescences by which Spanish literature is disfigured.
He therefore conceived he was rendering, though at
the risk of being reproached with pedantary,<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> an important
service to the literature of his country, by the
restoration and just application of those ancient and
only true principles which had long been acknowledged
and valued by the critics of foreign nations. In support
of his doctrines, Luzan regards the critical observations
of various French writers, particularly Rapin, Corneille,
Crousaz, Lamy, and Madame Dacier, as next
in authority to the works of Aristotle. He also availed
himself of the Italian works of Gravina and Muratori.
These, and other foreign authors, are quoted by name.
Spanish readers must, doubtless, have been not a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span>
surprised to find among the quotations passages from
French authors, given in the French language, under
the Spanish text. This was an unexampled phænomenon
in Spanish literature; and though a trifling circumstance
it serves to prove the increasing influence
of the French language in Spain.</p>

<p>The want of novelty in the principles of Luzan’s
Art of Poetry, is compensated by the new application
of those principles to Spanish literature. The arrangement
of the theory, which was introduced, also belongs,
at least in part, to himself; and in the developement
of that theory it is easy to recognize the man of judgment,
and the perfect master of his subject, though he
only improved what had been previously produced.
The work is divided into four parts or books. The
first developes, according to the notions of the author,
the origin, progress, and essence of poetry, (<i>el origen,
progressos y essencia de la poesia</i>.) The second book
explains the usefulness and pleasure of poetry, (<i>utilidad
y deleyte de la poesia</i>.) The third book treats,
at ample length, of tragedy, comedy, and other kinds
of dramatic composition; and the fourth of epic poetry.
These chief divisions present, indeed, only the outline
of Aristotle’s Art of Poetry; and Luzan’s work, can
no more than its prototype, be regarded as a complete
theory of the poetic art. In this respect Luzan went
no further than his predecessor, Lopez Pinciano, who
had long before equally clearly perceived that the work,
called Aristotle’s Art of Poetry, was, in fact, merely a
fragment.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> It is singular enough that Luzan takes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
no notice of Pinciano’s remarkable work; but whether
he was unacquainted with it, or whether he was intentionally
silent, cannot now be known. Within the boundaries
of his four unsystematic divisions, Luzan pursues
his own course; but the present is not the proper
occasion for accompanying him step by step. As,
however, the publication of Luzan’s book has been
attended by important consequences, it will be proper
to explain the manner in which this critic understood
the principles of Aristotle, and how he applied them to
Spanish literature.</p>

<p>Luzan in his exposition and application of Aristotle’s
theory, takes his departure from the same false
principle which misled all the French critics in the
age of Louis XIV. He views poetry closely and
directly on its moral side; but not in that comprehensive
manner in which every thing, when contemplated
on its moral side, ought to be examined; he regards
it merely as an art destined to aid morality, properly
so called; and that aid appears to him the more easily
given, because he adopts the maxim that the object
of poetry is to be at once useful and agreeable.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span>
Deceived by this gothic idea, which seems to have been
founded on the misunderstanding of a verse of Horace,
and which is certainly as old as modern literature, it
became impossible for him either to attain a just notion
of the poetic workings of the imagination, in relation to
the beautiful, or to discover the truth of the proposition
that such employment of the imagination possesses in
itself, under the proper restrictions, a moral value, and
ennobles human existence. Having fallen into the common
error, Luzan, like the French poets and critics, was
capable of taking only a very contracted view of poetic
beauty. Genuine simplicity and elegance, and in both a
delicate infusion of wit, formed with Luzan, as with the
French poets and critics, the summary of all poetic excellence.
According to these principles, the imagination
was regarded as merely the handmaid of the recreative
wit and the moralizing judgment. Genius was to be tied
down by rules in conformity with these narrow ideas
of the spirit and object of poetry. To satisfy the taste,
in the exercise of wit and judgment, was regarded as
the highest object of the poet’s efforts. The bold flight
to a freer and fairer world, whence the true poet derives
the spirit of his imaginings, in the imitation of nature,
was deemed merely an agreeable accessary. In a word,
the genuine essence of poetry was held to be an adventitious
ornament, while its station was usurped by mere
natural sentiment, and elegant or ingenious simplicity.</p>

<p>The useful and the agreeable, in the trivial signification
of the terms, are therefore the verbal pivots
around which Luzan’s whole poetic theory turns. It
is easy to conceive what degree of excellence and truth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
was to be derived from such principles in their application
to Spanish literature. Luzan zealously supported
the cause of good taste against the absurdities of the
Gongorists.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> He exposed, without reserve, the weak
side of Lope de Vega’s poetry; and the examples he
selects from the works of that poet, in order to shew
how far they are at variance with nature and reason,
prove precisely what they are intended to prove. But
to admire genius in its wanderings, and even in many
cases to prize those wanderings more than a frigid
elegance, required a view of the subject which Luzan’s
mind did not embrace. He was precisely the man to
detect and enumerate the errors of the favourite poetry
of his country; but he wanted the critical eye which
would have enabled him to do justice to its beauties.
After defining poetry to be an “imitation of nature,
either general or particular, made in verse, for utility
or amusement, or for both together,”<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> he goes on to
say, that little plays of wit, such as sonnets, madrigals,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>
and songs, may sometimes have no other object than
agreeable amusement; but that in poetry of a more
important kind, such as comedies, tragedies, and
epopee, the useful and the agreeable must necessarily
be combined together, that is to say, the work must at
once instruct and entertain. Accordingly, when he
comes to treat more particularly of dramatic poetry,
he says, “tragedy is such an imitation of an action as
is calculated to correct fear, pity, or other passions;
but a comedy must be an action so represented as to
inspire love of some virtue, or hatred and abhorrence
of some vice or fault.”<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> It is not necessary to particularize
the judgments which a critic, armed with
these opinions, must have pronounced on the Spanish
drama. Luzan not only blamed the Spanish dramatists
for the violation of the Aristotelian unities, on the
ground that such violation was contrary to nature; but
he even condemned as not moral, or at least not sufficiently
moral, the genuine nature which he could not
avoid recognizing in their works. He, however says,
that what is first to be esteemed in the Spanish dramatists,
“is in general their ingenious invention, their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span>
extraordinary wit and judgment, admirable and essential
qualities in great poets. Lope de Vega merits particular
praise for the natural facility of his style, and
the adroit way in which he has in many of his comedies
painted the customs and the character of certain
persons. I admire in Calderon the dignity of his language,
which without ever being obscure or affected is
always elegant.”<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> He proceeds to eulogize the art of
ingenious developement displayed in Calderon’s dramas
of intrigue; and attributes a similar merit to some of
the comedies of Antonio de Solis and Moretto. Under
the same point of view he judges the writings of the
later Spanish dramatists, on which he confers particular
commendation on account of their superior regularity.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a>
Next follows a list of the faults, which, according to
the above principles, he imputes to the Spanish drama
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>
in general, and to the favourite dramatic poets of the
Spanish public in particular; and on this subject he
makes many just observations. He had good reasons
for not venturing to attack the Spanish Autos. He
accordingly dismisses them very briefly, pronouncing no
literary judgment on them, and merely observes that
they are allegorical representations in honour of “the
most holy sacrament of the altar.”</p>

<p>Thus did a critic, whose voice a century earlier
would scarcely have been heard, systematically undertake
to reform Spanish taste. It appears from Luzan’s
introductory observations that he was either not sufficiently
acquainted with the history of the poetry of his
nation, or had forgotten most essential facts, otherwise he
never could have adopted the notion that Spanish taste
had degenerated for want of learned critics to open the
eyes of the public. The Spaniards of Luzan’s age paid
no more attention to his Art of Poetry, than their
ancestors had bestowed on Lopez Pinciano’s, which inculcated
the same principles two hundred years earlier,
when the Spanish drama was in its infancy. But the
members of the Spanish academy regarded Luzan’s
book with as much veneration, as if through it the light
of pure taste had first been disclosed to Spain; and
thus was the academy at length placed in conflict with
the public it sought to improve. Whether all the members
of that literary institution concurred in Luzan’s
plans of critical reformation cannot now be known. This,
however, is certain, that nothing was written in defence
of the national style, either by an academician or by any
other critic or amateur; and all the writers, who, since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span>
that period, have by means of critical treatises and new
dramas, zealously laboured to improve the dramatic
literature of Spain, according to French principles, have
been members of the Spanish academy.</p>

<p>Luzan himself did his utmost to support his theory
by some original poetic productions and translations
from the French. He translated one of Lachausée’s
comedies; but with what success it was represented on
the Spanish stage is not mentioned. It was, however,
followed by various translations of French dramas by
other writers.</p>

<p id="LUZANS_POETIC_COMPOSITIONS">Luzan’s poetic compositions are certainly honourably
distinguished by correctness, facility and elegance, and
by what may be termed the poetry of language, from
the works of the Gongorists which at that time were
not entirely exploded in Spain. They consist of occasional
poems and poetic trifles, such as might have been
written without the aid of genius by any man of cultivated
mind, possessing a certain degree of descriptive
talent. Zealous Gallicist as Luzan was, he had too much
solidity of taste to attempt an imitation of the structure
of French verse in the Spanish language; and accordingly
his contributions to the poetic literature of his country
are in the usual national metres. A poem in octaves,
which he read on the opening of the academy of
painting, sculpture and architecture, in 1752, fifteen
years before the publication of his Art of Poetry, received
particular approbation. He read poetic compositions
of the same kind on several occasions. Some of
his odes and canciones were not published till after his decease;
among the number are two on the re-taking of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span>
Fortress of Oran;<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> an occasional poem, entitled, the Judgment
of Paris, which is prettily conceived, and elegantly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span>
executed;<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> and some poems imitated from the Greek of
Anacreon and Sappho.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> Luzan died in the year 1754.</p>

<h3 id="MAYANS_Y_SISCAR_BLAS_NASARRE">MAYANS Y SISCAR&mdash;BLAS NASSARE.</h3>

<p>Among the contemporaries of Luzan, the royal
librarian, Gregorio Mayans y Siscar, is entitled to praise,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span>
for having, in biographical, literary and rhetorical
works, furnished many hints and notices which throw
light on the history of Spanish poetry and eloquence.
His collection of detached writings on the History of the
Spanish Language, (<i>Origenes de la Lengua Española</i>),
embraces more than the title promises; and among other
things contains a well written discourse exhorting authors
to pursue the true idea of Spanish eloquence.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> But his
diffuse Art of Rhetoric,<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> which he published twenty
years later than the work last mentioned, is merely a
formal compilation of the ideas and criticisms of Aristotle
and modern writers. It might with equal propriety
be entitled an art of poetry. The examples
given from the poets are long and numerous.</p>

<p>Blas Antonio Nassare, prelate and academician, laboured
to attain the same kind of merit. He was,
however, so blinded by his predilection for French literature,
that he considered the eight comedies of Cervantes,
which he first restored to light, as parodies on
the style of Lope de Vega.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a></p>

<h3 id="MONTIANOS_TRAGEDIES">MONTIANO’S TRAGEDIES IN THE FRENCH STYLE.</h3>

<p>Agustin de Montiano y Luyando, who was counsellor
of state, director of the academy of history,
and a member of the Spanish academy, undertook to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span>
introduce regular tragedy on the Spanish stage according
to Luzan’s principles. With this view he wrote
two tragedies, the one entitled <i>Virginia</i>, and the other
<i>Ataulpho</i>, in which, with the exception of the rhymeless
iambics, which he substituted for the French
Alexandrines, he has most anxiously endeavoured to
fulfil all the conditions required by French criticism.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a>
Both these tragedies are remarkable for pure and correct
language; for the cautious avoidance of false metaphor;
and for a certain natural style of expression, which
is sometimes wanting even in the dramas of Corneille
and Racine. They are, however, formed on the French
model with such scrupulous nicety that they might
be mistaken for translations.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> It is scarcely necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span>
to mention, that in these tragedies the Aristotelian
unities are rigidly observed, and that in the Virginia
the father does not stab his daughter on the stage.</p>

<p>To the play of Virginia which was published in
1750, some years before Ataulpho, Montiano annexed
a historical critical treatise on Spanish tragedy.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a>
Patriotism had certainly some share in this treatise;
for in the first place, Montiano wished historically to
defend his countrymen against the reproach that no
Spanish tragedy had ever been written; and secondly,
he wished in his Virginia to furnish the first experiment
of a Spanish tragedy, without violation of dramatic
rules, though he did not pretend to set up that specimen
as a model. He states, with all due modesty, that his
work cost him much labour, and expresses a hope that
his countrymen will be induced to imitate his example,
to disregard the approbation of the ignorant multitude,
and to strive to do better than he had done.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> In a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span>
preface to his tragedy of Ataulpho he enlarges on the
same theme.</p>

<h3 id="VELASQUEZ">VELASQUEZ.</h3>

<p>Among the number of the Spanish Gallicists must
likewise be included that intelligent writer Luis Joseph
de Velasquez. His History of Spanish Poetry, (<i>Origenes
de la Poesia Española</i>), which was published in
1754, proves that the Spaniards had then, in a great
measure, forgotten their national literature. Velasquez
unquestionably took considerable pains to collect, with
critical spirit, those facts which were probably better
known to him than to any of his contemporaries; and
yet he has, upon the whole, obscured rather than
elucidated the history of Spanish poetry. His criticism
is quite in the French style, with a slight tincture of
Spanish patriotism. Velasquez was a member of the
French academy of inscriptions and belles lettres.</p>

<p>Not a single Spanish poet of distinguished merit
flourished during the first half of the eighteenth century.
That such a barrenness should have succeeded
so great a fertility of talent, is a circumstance which the
exhaustion of the national spirit does not sufficiently
explain. It is also necessary to take into the account
the conflict maintained between favour shewn to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span>
French style and the demands of the Spanish public.
Supported by national approbation, the Spanish poetry
had gloriously flourished; but it perished when new
arbiters of taste, who judged according to foreign principles,
could with impunity treat the Spanish public
as an ignorant multitude.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> In this collision Spanish
eloquence sustained no immediate injury. The influence
of the French style, could indeed at that time
do it no injury, for at the commencement of the eighteenth
century, French prose was fitted to serve as a
model for clearness, precision, facility and elegance.
But no aspiring spirit now animated Spanish authors.
Books written in correct prose were produced in sufficient
numbers; and yet no work appeared which deserved
particular distinction for rhetorical merit, or
which contributed in any degree to invigorate the
literature of Spain.</p>

<h3 id="CONCLUDING_PERIOD_OF_THE_HISTORY_OF_SPANISH_POETRY">CONCLUDING PERIOD OF THE HISTORY OF SPANISH
POETRY AND ELOQUENCE.</h3>

<p>The Spanish writers who lived about the middle of
the eighteenth century, began to be ashamed of the
unworthy bondage which had severed them from all
common feeling with the public taste. It is doubtful
whether at this particular period, the nation in general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span>
began once more to be roused to a sense of its own
importance; but this is certain, that a literary patriotism
imperceptibly revived within the narrow circle of Spanish
authorship. Even several members of the Spanish
academy proved that they were no longer to be satisfied
with mere French elegance. The works of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were again received
into favour. Men of superior talents arose, who endeavoured
to combine Spanish genius with French
elegance; and the literature of Spain began to acquire
a new life.</p>

<h3 id="LA_HUERTA">LA HUERTA.</h3>

<p>One of the first who openly attacked the party
of the Gallicists, was the patriotic Vicente Garcia de
la Huerta, a member of the Spanish academy, and
librarian to the king. None but a man whose literary
judgments were accredited by the same honourable
posts which gave peculiar weight to those of the
Gallicists, could at that time hope to oppose with success
the fashionable opinion concerning Spanish literature.
La Huerta, however, undertook a dangerous task, for
with every talent and right feeling for genuine poetry,
he was by no means a skilful critic. In systematic
coolness of judgment he was incompetent to enter the
lists with men of Luzan’s critical ability. The true
principles on which Spanish poetry was to be defended
against French criticism, were at that period not at all
understood; and La Huerta was not the man to discover
them. But his feeling acted in the place of his
judgment. It groped on when abandoned by theory,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span>
and rejected every theory to which it could not be reconciled.
Conscious of his deficiency, La Huerta was
extremely diffident whenever his opinions came into
collision with those of Luzan and other academicians.
But when his task was to reply to the observations of
French critics, his patriotic enthusiasm knew no bounds.
In exercising the law of retaliation, he attacked the
admired Coryphæi of the French Parnassus with a
grossness which would cast a stigma on his reputation
for taste, did not his other works sufficiently prove
him to have been unjust, only through the excess of a
just indignation. Fortunately for La Huerta, it was
not until his works had obtained decided credit that he
openly avowed his hostility to the Gallicists. Among
the poems which first conferred celebrity on his name,
is a piscatory eclogue, which he read at a distribution
of academic prizes in the year 1760. This purely
occasional effusion is written in the national lyric style
of the eclogues of the best period of Spanish poetry,
and is free from orientalisms.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> Three years afterwards,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span>
on a similar occasion, he read a mythological poem
in stanzas. These were succeeded by other poems,
also of occasional origin, by which La Huerta disarmed
the critics, who might have been disposed to
assert that he was destitute of the necessary feeling for
French elegance. The romances by which he sought to
give to that style of national poetry a new existence
in the elegant world, seem to have been written at
various periods of his life. Besides lyric romances,
which had not entirely lost their ancient consideration,
he composed narrative romances in the old style. In one
of the latter compositions his success is remarkable.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span>
He likewise revived the Spanish custom of composing
poetic glosses; and some of his sonnets deserve the
highest praise. That he was well acquainted with latin
and French poetry is evident from his metrical translations
of some of Horace’s odes, and of several fragments
from the works of the French poets.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a></p>

<p>But he had greater difficulties to overcome in his
endeavours to restore the Spanish drama to its former
lustre. He was not so great a poet as to be able to
advance, accompanied by French elegance, in the same
course in which Calderon had stopped. Calderon’s
dramas were, however, still performed with approbation,
in spite of all that was said by the critics, and La
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span>
Huerta wrote for one of these pieces a prologue (<i>loa</i>)
in the old style. At length when he thought he could
rely on the favour of a certain portion of the public, he
came forward with his first essay in tragic art. His
<i>Raquel</i>, (Rachel), a tragedy, which was intended to
combine the old Spanish forms with the dignity of the
French tragic style, without being subject to the French
rules of dramatic art, was first performed at the court
theatre of Madrid in 1778. For upwards of half a
century no new drama had been received with such
enthusiasm by the Spanish public. It was represented
at every theatre in Spain; and even before it was
printed upwards of two thousand copies were taken,
and many sent as far as America.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> The Gallicists in
Spain now rose in opposition to La Huerta; but he
replied to them in a tone of contemptuous haughtiness,
while he always observed the strictest modesty in addressing
the public.</p>

<p>La Huerta’s Rachel is not a master-piece; but it is
a noble testimony of the poetic national feeling of an
ingenious writer, who exerted his utmost endeavours to
restore the credit of the Spanish drama. The subject
is taken from the old history of Castile. King Alphonso
VIII. who has resigned his heart and his royal
dignity to the fair Jewess Rachel, is implored by the people
and the nobility to shake off the dishonourable yoke.
He hesitates between love and duty, until the spirit of
discontent, which has been with difficulty repressed,
breaks forth in rebellion. While the king is out hunting,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">581</span>
Rachel is surprised in the palace, and her base counsellor,
Ruben, murders her to save his own life; which
he only preserves until the arrival of the king, by
whom he is killed in return. The tragedy is divided,
according to the old practice, into three <i>jornadas</i>;
but, in other respects, it is obvious that the
author took considerable pains to conform, under certain
limitations, to the French rules of dramatic art. The
dialogue proceeds uniformly in iambic blank verse,
without the introduction of sonnets, or any other kind
of metre. All irregular theatrical pageantry is avoided.
The language, upon the whole, preserves a dignified
character; and in several scenes the tragic pathos is
complete.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> But the composition fails in the distribution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span>
of the characters. Only a feeble light is thrown
on Rachel, the heroine of the tragedy. Her counsellor,
Ruben, is a stupid contemptible Jew, whose lamentations
in the moment of danger border closely on the
ludicrous;<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> and the weak character of the king, who
changes his resolutions on every new impression, frequently
approaches caricature. The author has, however,
succeeded admirably in exhibiting a striking contrast
in the characters of two Spanish grandees:&mdash;the
one is a base courtier, named Manrique; while the other,
Garcia de Castro, in all his sentiments and actions is a
correct representative of the spirit of ancient Spanish
chivalry in its purest dignity. In the patriotic portraiture
of this character, La Huerta’s whole soul is
developed;<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> and the national spirit which pervades the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">583</span>
tragedy, doubtless contributed in no small degree to
ensure its celebrity.</p>

<p id="His_tragedies">La Huerta’s tragedy of <i>Agamemnon Vengado</i>, is a
work of trivial importance compared with Rachel. It
is founded on the prose translation of the Electra of
Sophocles, which Perez de Oliva produced two hundred
years earlier;<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> but it is a remarkable, and by no means
unsuccessful attempt to unite the romantic and the
classic forms, according to the conditions required by a
modern audience. La Huerta wrote his Agamemnon
in compliance with the wishes of some ladies of Madrid,
who were desirous of seeing a tragedy in the Grecian
costume. The place of the chorus is, after the French
manner, supplied by a female confidante. Part of the
scenes are entirely taken from Sophocles, others are those
of the original remoulded, and some are new. From
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">584</span>
the beginning to the end of the tragedy, the poetic
language is admirably preserved; and the alternation
of the rhymeless iambics with octaves and lyric metres,
completes the beauty of the whole.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a></p>

<p id="His_Spanish_theatre">Finally, La Huerta adapted Voltaire’s <i>Zaire</i> to the
Spanish stage. After he had unquestionably acquired
the right of pronouncing a decided opinion on the literature
of his country, he published his <i>Theatro Hespañol</i>;
and in his prefaces to some of the volumes of that
collection, he launched forth his invectives against the
French drama.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> La Huerta’s <i>Theatro Hespañol</i> is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span>
classic selection from the incalculable store of Spanish
dramas; and the selection is certainly well made consistently
with the plan which he had adopted. With
the view of marking his hostility towards the Gallicists,
he selected only those Spanish comedies which are particularly
distinguished for elegant ingenuity in point of
invention and execution. Thus upwards of three-fourths
of the whole collection consists of <i>comedias de
capa y espada</i>, chiefly from the pen of Calderon. But
for this very reason the work does not properly fulfil its
title, as it exhibits the Spanish theatre only under one
point of view. La Huerta has not even selected a single
piece from Lope de Vega, because the plays of that great
dramatist were not sufficiently elegant for his purpose:
neither has he granted a place to the most beautiful
of Calderon’s heroic comedies, being deterred from inserting
them by their irregularity; and in conformity
with the plan he had laid down, he could with still less
propriety admit an <i>Auto</i> into his collection. By this
work he, however, attained the objects he had in view,
which were to restore the Spanish national comedy to
its honourable place in literature, and to vent his feelings
of indignation against the Gallicists. He treats the
Italian authors, who had openly avowed their disapproval
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">586</span>
of the Spanish drama, with no less severity than he had
evinced towards the French critics. Quadrio, Tiraboschi,
Bettinelli, and other writers “of the same breed,”
(<i>de la misma raza</i>), are denounced by La Huerta as
malignant and envious critics. He accuses Signorelli,
of “notorious falsehood.” “Childish egotism,” he says,
is the soul of French criticism. The icy coldness of
French tragedy was with him more offensive than the
neglect of rules in the Spanish drama. Racine, the
favourite tragic writer of the French school, owed his
fame solely to the “tedious scrupulosity,” which he
observed in composing his tragedies, but not to the
“masculine vigour of genius, or the fire and spirit of
fancy.” The “natural sublimity” of Spanish genius
could not be restrained by the fetters of the French
school. Luzan, though in many respects a very estimable
author, was imbued with prejudices. Velasquez,
with all his delicacy and erudition had fallen into the
errors and misconceptions of Luzan. In general, Spanish
poetry had, like the Spanish nation, a certain
<i>oriental</i> character, which it was fit it should preserve.
French imitations of Spanish dramas of intrigue are
declared perfectly insupportable; and, in particular, the
Marriage of Figaro, “a comedy altogether contemptible,”
(<i>despreciada en todas sus partes</i>.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a>)</p>

<p>La Huerta remained a debtor to the public for the
critical grounds of these denunciations, which called
forth the bitterest answers from the adverse party, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">587</span>
also for a reply to his opponents. He asserted briefly
and bluntly that those opponents were merely “a ludicrous
pack of cynical and drivelling critics, the vehicles
of envy, ignorance, and imbecility.” What might
not this patriotic author have effected had he been as
energetic in his reasoning as in his abuse! He nevertheless
appears to have contributed more than any of
his contemporaries to produce a re-action in Spanish
literature, which was indispensable to give to that
literature the opportunity of again acquiring a poetic
elevation.</p>

<h3 id="SEDANO">SEDANO.</h3>

<p>The publication of the choice Spanish poems, collected
by Don Juan Joseph Lopez de Sedano, was a
circumstance very favourable to the restoration of the
poetry of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to its
proper place in Spanish literature. This work appeared
in the year 1768, under the title of the <i>Parnaso Español</i>;
but there certainly would have been little difficulty
in producing a better collection. The notions
which Sedano entertained respecting religion and morality
have induced him to mingle not a few bad and
indifferent productions with poems of superior merit;
and it was by no means a happy idea to reprint long
translations, such, for example, as the whole of Tasso’s
Amynta, when so much of the rich fruit of the original
Spanish stock remained ungathered. But the undertaking
was praiseworthy; and the biographical and literary
notices annexed to the work rendered the Spanish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">588</span>
public once more acquainted with estimable authors
whom it ought never to have forgotten.</p>

<h3 id="YRIARTE">YRIARTE.</h3>

<p>Tomas de Yriarte, general archivist to the high council
of war, and translator to one of the ministerial departments
of state in Madrid, combined French elegance
with the ancient forms of Spanish poetry in a manner very
different from that of La Huerta. After he had acquired
a certain degree of reputation by several translations of
French dramas, by original poems in the latin language,
and various other literary labours, he obtained more
decidedly the favour of the elegant portion of the Spanish
public by his <i>Fabulas Literarias</i>, (Literary Fables),
which were first printed in the year 1782.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a>
Yriarte conceived the novel idea of rendering literary
truths, many of which may at the same time be regarded
as moral truths, themes for fables in the style
of Æsop; and of composing these fables in every variety
of verse which was in any way applicable to them. No
classical fabulist had hitherto appeared in Spanish literature.
Yriarte’s fables are, however, not only remarkable
for their classic language and excellent versification, but
they possess a peculiar charm of style which may be mistaken
for a happy imitation of the manner of Lafontaine,
though it is to be traced to a different source. Like Lafontaine,
Yriarte had a true feeling for that delicate harmony
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">589</span>
which is so indispensable to the fabulist, and for that
spirited infantine style, which, in a graceful prattling,
playfully unfolds the truth as it were intuitively, and,
as it ought always to be disclosed, in apologue, without
the slightest trace of didactic design. He had no need
to turn to the writings of foreigners in quest of the literary
elements of such a style. It was only necessary to
combine the exquisite simplicity of many old Spanish romances
and songs, with the true spirit of Æsopian fable,
and his narrative style could not fail to assume the tone
in which it so successfully rivalled the manner of Lafontaine.
Accordingly among Yriarte’s sixty-seven literary
fables, those which are composed in redondillas and
other kinds of Spanish national measures, possess the superiority
in point of graceful execution. Some are not
remarkable for their didactic merits. But even when
the idea, or what is styled the moral, presents no particular
interest, Yriarte’s fables please by the graceful handling
of the subject: an example of this may be seen in
the fable of the Ass, which finding a flute in a meadow,
accidentally breathes into the lip-hole with his nose, and
on hearing the tone of the instrument, persuades himself
that nature has qualified him for a musician.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">590</span>
Whether Yriarte wholly invented these fables, is a question
which can only be decided by laborious investigation.
One of the number, in so far as regards the lesson
or moral, precisely resembles Gellert’s fable of the
Painter in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> Yet this circumstance by no
means warrants the inference that it is borrowed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">591</span></p>

<p>Considerable praise has been bestowed on a didactic
poem by Yriarte, entitled Music;<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> but with all
the merits which this production may in other respects
possess, it is no less deficient in the true characteristics
of a didactic poem, than are the earlier essays of the
Spaniards in the same class. It is judiciously conceived,
executed with the requisite elegance of language, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">592</span>
contains many passages which are by no means destitute
of poetic beauty.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> But the systematic form is not disguised
by poetic composition. Instead of diffusing a
poetic interest over the truths which were to be inculcated,
and presenting even the instruction as a picture
of the imagination, according to the proper though seldom
realized idea of a didactic poem, Yriarte, like most
didactic poets, regarded instruction as the main object,
and the creations of poetic fancy merely as accessory
embellishments: thus three-fourths of his work consist
only of elegantly versified prose.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">593</span></p>

<h3 id="LEON_DE_ARROYAL">LEON DE ARROYAL.</h3>

<p>To give an account of all the other poets, who at
the latter end of the eighteenth century contributed to
restore the credit of Spanish poetry, is a task which
must be consigned to other historians of literature, who
may possess favourable opportunities for rendering themselves
intimately acquainted with the more recent productions
of Spanish genius. A considerable number of
bibliographic notices which would contribute to the
accomplishment of this object are extant.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a></p>

<p>In taking a survey, however, of the latest period of
the history of Spanish poetry, the odes of Leon de Arroyal
must not be overlooked.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> Though these odes are inferior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">594</span>
to the older Spanish productions of the same sort, yet
some of them are distinguished, not indeed for bold, but
for airy flights of fancy;<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> and for harmonious versification.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a>
At the time of their appearance there were likewise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">595</span>
published anonymously some anacreontic songs
by a lady, who imitated Villegas with grace as well
as with decorum.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a></p>

<h3 id="JUAN_MELENDEZ_VALDES">JUAN MELENDEZ VALDES.</h3>

<p>But a poet of the graces, who has had but few equals
even in the golden ages of Spanish poetry, and who excels
in his particular sphere, remains to be noticed. This ornament
of modern Spanish literature, is Juan Melendez
Valdes, a doctor of law, and, perhaps, still professor of polite
literature in Salamanca. A delicate fancy, ever lively,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">596</span>
yet ever true to nature; an uncommon intensity of feeling;
graceful turns of thought; a classic precision and
elegance of language, and the most pleasing flow of
versification, exist in so eminent a degree, and are
so happily combined in this author’s works, that the
critic is compelled to become a panegyrist, if he be
not totally insensible to the charm which such a phenomenon
presents in modern poetry.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> At an early period
of life, Melendez began to retrace the footsteps of Horace,
Tibullus, Anacreon, and Villegas; but, as he must
have felt that the luxuriant graces of his Spanish model
were not to be excelled, his imagination appears to
have spontaneously applied itself to a more exquisite
painting of amatory ideas and images, and to the dignifying
of that kind of poetry by a certain moral delicacy
to the observance of which Villegas attached too little
importance. The joys, sorrows, and sports of rustic love,
rural festivals and amusements, are the materials which
confer a peculiar character on the anacreontic effusions
of Melendez. Were it not that the picturesque descriptions
sufficiently indicate the Spaniard,<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> his verses might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">597</span>
sometimes be mistaken for translations from an English
or German poet. Nothing can surpass some of his descriptions
in the graceful colouring of tender sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">598</span>
It is only necessary to bestow a slight glance on the compositions
of Melendez to feel the injustice of the reproach
cast on Spanish poetry, by a French traveller, who observes
“that the Spaniard is so completely a citizen, that
not even in his poetry does he manifest a taste for rural
life.” This reproach, which is probably only directed
against the poetic writers of the present day, would be
unworthy of notice were it intended to apply to the Spanish
poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">599</span>
whose numerous pastoral compositions abound in descriptions
of rural scenery, which evince an intuitive perception
of the poetic beauties of unsophisticated nature.
Be this as it may, the Spanish academy thought proper,
in the year 1780, to award a prize for the best poem in
praise of rural life; and on this occasion Melendez
gloriously competed with Yriarte.</p>

<p>Besides the anacreontic poems of Melendez, his
lyric romances, his popular songs, in which the old
national style is combined with modern elegance, his
romantic odes, his elegies and his sonnets, must be numbered
among the best productions in Spanish literature.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a>
How admirably he succeeded in the composition of
poetic epistles is proved by the classical dedication of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">600</span>
poems to his friend Jovellanos.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> He has rendered service
to the Spanish theatre by dramatizing the novel of
the rich Camacho from Don Quixote. He is also the
author of several treatises on moral and philosophical
subjects.</p>

<h3 id="BRIEF_NOTICE_OF_SOME">BRIEF NOTICE OF SOME OF THE MORE RECENT
LITERARY PRODUCTIONS OF SPAIN.</h3>

<p>If the above information respecting some of the
latest Spanish poets be connected with the general
observations and bibliographic notices in the preceding
part of this history, it will plainly appear that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">601</span>
the revival of polite literature in Spain must have been
on the one hand accelerated, and on the other retarded,
by the progress which was made in the cultivation of
modern science and philosophy, during the latter years
of the eighteenth century. The period of the triumph
of the Gallicists is doubtless past, however numerous the
adherents of that party still may be. But in general
the Spaniards of the educated and refined classes still
blush for their ancient prejudices, and observe, with
regret, that the Spanish literature is now only labouring
to acquire what it long ago neglected. In order to raise
the elegant literature of Spain to a level with that of
other cultivated nations of modern Europe, it is deemed
necessary to continue with persevering spirit to translate,
adapt and imitate every foreign work which attains
any degree of celebrity. In this concurrence of the spirit
of foreign literature with the ancient national spirit,
which is by no means suffered to perish, more than one
decennial period of the present century will probably
elapse ere Spanish poetry resume its original independence.</p>

<p>Among their modern dramas, the Spaniards particularly
esteem the regular tragedies of Nicolas Fernandez
de Moratin, and the comedies of Ramon de la
Cruz, who, previous to the year 1784, was computed to
have written upwards of two hundred interludes in the
old style. Spanish translations of the tragedies of Corneille
and Voltaire, of the plays of Moliere, and other
French comic writers, and of the sentimental dramas
of Mercier, have also been received with approbation.
Don Leandro Fernandez de Moratin, who must not be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">602</span>
confounded with his namesake, travelled at the expense
of the Spanish government to study the dramatic literature
of the different nations of Europe; and since his
return to Spain, a considerable pension has been granted
to him as a reward for one of his dramatic productions.
He has rendered the tragedy of Hamlet into Spanish,
and is expected to give to his countrymen a complete
translation of Shakespeare. Don Luciano Francisco
Comella, who is mentioned in literary journals as one
of the rivals of Leandro de Moratin in comic poetry,
appears to be a very prolific writer, and inclined to the
old national style. Don Theodoro de la Calla has attempted
to give Shakespeare’s Othello in Spanish, from
a French translation. Comella has also dramatized several
recent historical events, among which are some
points in the history of Peter the Great, and Catharine
II. of Russia.</p>

<p>The Count de Noroña has particularly distinguished
himself as a writer of lyric poetry, and he has also translated
Dryden’s Alexander’s Feast into Spanish verse.</p>

<p>Joseph Vasquez Cadalso, and the younger Moratin,
may be ranked among the most successful writers of
satirical poetry which Spain has recently produced.</p>

<p><i>Diana</i>, or the <i>Hunt</i>, by the elder Moratin; the
<i>Happy Man</i>, by Almeida; and the <i>Happy Woman</i>,
by Morino, are the latest productions in didactic poetry.
A Spanish translation of <i>How to be always Merry</i>,
from the German of Uz, also occurs in the notices of
new Spanish poems.</p>

<p>The old ambition of the Spaniards to distinguish
themselves by some production in epic art has again
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">603</span>
revived. A work of this class, entitled, <i>Mexico Conquistada</i>,
by Don Juan de Escoiquiz, has excited some
attention.</p>

<p>Spanish pastorals in the old national style are associated
with translations from the German of Gessner.</p>

<p>The collision of the natural and foreign styles is
strikingly exemplified in the Spanish romance literature
of the present period. The old romance of <i>Cassandra</i>
has lately been re-printed; and a new one in the old
style, entitled, <i>Leandra</i>, has also made its appearance.
All the English and French novels which obtain any
celebrity, are now translated into Spanish.</p>

<p>Elegant prose, which was earlier cultivated in Spain
than in any other country in Europe, seems at length
to have emancipated itself from the Gongorism which
threatened its destruction. The prevailing study of
French prose in Spain, has no doubt proved favourable
to the revival of the pure eloquence of the
writers of the sixteenth century. None, indeed, of
the more recent works in Spanish prose is eminently
distinguished for rhetorical composition. But on the
other hand, among these publications it would be
difficult to mention a single book of science, whether
original or translated, which is not written with a
certain degree of purity and elegance. An historical
work in the Spanish language has been for some time
announced, and is probably now before the public. It
is a History of America, by D. Juan Bautista Muñoz,
professor of philosophy at Valencia. The intention of
the author is to exhibit the conduct of the Spaniards
in America in a point of view different from that taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">604</span>
by Robertson; and the work is said to be remarkable
for beauty of style.</p>

<p>The Art of Rhetoric,<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> by Don Antonio de Capmany,
a member of the Spanish Academy of History,
affords a new proof of the importance which the Spaniards
attach to the cultivation of elegant prose. The
preface to this work is particularly instructive. The
book itself contains no new truths, but it presents the
old ones well arranged and judiciously selected. Capmany’s
work, and particularly the preface, clearly shews
that Spanish eloquence is still, in some measure, in a
divided state. The classic prose of the sixteenth century
is again esteemed. But in any endeavour to restore
this prose unchanged, it must be difficult to avoid the
appearance of affectation; for since the prevalence of
the French taste, many Spanish words and phrases,
which were formerly classical, have now become antiquated,
while on the other hand, old words and phrases
have been introduced from the French. The party of
the <i>purists</i>, as the adherents of the old style are denominated,
have the prevailing language of the polite
world against them; while the polite world and the
partizans of the French style, can adduce no good
reasons for rejecting the old style, which is acknowledged
to be pure Castilian. Capmany is decidedly
favourable to the new style.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> However, this conflict
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">605</span>
will not prove injurious to Spanish eloquence, if each
party be willing to make concessions, in order that the
old style may be fundamentally preserved, and yet be so
modified as to conform, without affectation, to the new
ideas and forms of language which modern science has
introduced.</p>

<p>All these facts considered in their connexion as a
whole, leave no room to doubt that the polite literature
of the Spaniards may again rise to its former glory, if
favoured by the ancient national spirit, to the genial
influence of which it owes its existence. The two
academies of polite literature, (<i>de buenas letras</i>), at
Barcelona and Seville, may likewise contribute to the
fulfilment of this object, if they seriously devote their
attention to it. The talent of the Spanish improvisatori,
who are said to be in no way inferior to those of Italy,
may also be directed to the revival of the ancient
popular poetry. Since the works of the poets and
elegant prose writers of the golden age of Spanish
literature have lately been republished in elegant editions,
and universally circulated, and since the new
demands of reason and science have promoted the developement
of the mental faculty in Spain, the best
results may be expected from the union of elegant and
scientific learning.</p>

<h3 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>It is only after having duly studied the polite literature
of Spain in all its parts, with the interest
attached to literary investigation, that it is possible to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">606</span>
characterize it as a whole, and to obtain possession of
the results which such a characteristic judgment ought
to present.</p>

<p>I. Spanish poetry is more decidedly national than
any other branch of modern poetry in Europe. Even
the Italians have only transferred their spirit and character
into forms; which, though ennobled by a genial
classic refinement of style, were originally derived from
the Provençals. But the Spanish, or to speak with
more precision, the Castilian poetry, which arose in the
neighbourhood of the Provençal, is a peculiar stream
from the romantic Parnassus. When the Spaniards
admitted the Italian forms into their poetry, they did
not transfer the old Spanish character to these nationalized
forms, in the same manner as the Italians,
by classic improvement of style, and enlargement of
the boundaries of romantic composition, converted the
Provençal poetry into pure Italian poetry. The Spanish
poets made the classic purity, and polish of the Italian
forms, subservient in a new manner to the orientalism
of their ancient national literature. A tendency to the
old orientalism is indeed plainly perceptible even in the
works of the few Spanish poets, who were the most
disposed, like Luis de Leon, Cervantes, and the two
Argensolas, to adopt the opinions of the ancients and
the Italians with regard to the correctness of ideas and
images. This orientalism of the Spanish character and
poetry which has long been disapproved, is now decidedly
pronounced bad taste, because the general idea of
poetry, which is the same for all ages and all nations, is
superseded by Greek, Italian, or French national ideas;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">607</span>
and thus that beauty which is general is made subject
to particular and subordinate laws. But as long as the
ideal creations of the imagination are not entirely at
variance with reason and nature, they may far overstep
the boundaries of the Greek and other national forms,
without violating the supreme laws of the beautiful. A
true theory of taste should therefore induce us to look
beyond all factitious limits of the creative and plastic
powers of imagination for a critical point of view, which
has only nature and reason for its basis. Considered
from such a point of view, that orientalism, which is
ridiculous and absurd, becomes at once distinguishable
from that which belongs to the truly sublime and
beautiful. Spanish poets, it is true, have often failed
to observe this distinction. But owing to the usual
mode of estimating Spanish literature in the mass,
justice has not been done to that genuine beauty which
it so conspicuously discloses even in the midst of
absurdity.</p>

<p>II. This unjust system of criticism appears to account
for the very slight attention which has been paid to the
high elegance and classic purity of a considerable portion
of the polite literature of Spain. In this respect Cervantes
alone outweighs a whole host of the correct
Gallicists, whose highest merit is to have written interesting
prose in well constructed verse. Metrical
elegance is indeed a distinguishing property in many
of the most irregular productions of the Spanish poets;
this is evident in their comedies, and more particularly
in the comedies of Calderon, which present the highest
charm of rhythmical harmony. On this occasion the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">608</span>
classic prose of the golden age of Spanish literature
ought also to be brought to recollection. In the number
of prose works distinguished for elegance of style and
intellectual energy of composition, the literature of Spain
far surpasses that of Italy.</p>

<p>III. The deficiency of one kind of riches in Spanish
literature, is amply compensated by the abundance of
another kind, which is in a great measure peculiar to
that literature, and which has manifested itself in an
inconceivable number of works. The portion of lyric
poetry in which the Spaniards have imitated the Italian
forms, tolerably counterbalances the amount of Italian
poetry in the same style. But if to that portion be added
the whole store of lyric romances and songs in the old
popular style, a multitude appears which sets calculation
at defiance. Nothing, however, could be more absurd,
than to estimate the poetic fertility of a nation according
to the number of works called poems, which it
may possess. It is from the sum of genuine poetry actually
existing in any considerable number of such works,
though it should be visible only in the seed or in the
bud which has withered in the opening, that the balance
must be struck when the poetic riches of nations is the
subject of comparison. If the mere number of productions
were to decide, Italy would be as rich in dramatic
literature as Spain. But in Italy, it unfortunately
happened that scarcely any writers except those of middling
and even inferior talent laboured to increase the
stock of Italian dramas to infinity. In Spanish dramatic
literature, on the contrary, the most fertile writers shew
themselves to be great poets even amidst their faults.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">609</span>
According to the same principle the multitude of
nominal epic poems, which have appeared in Spain,
and in which scarcely a feeble spark of true epopee is
discernible, must not be taken into account in estimating
the poetic treasures of Spanish literature. A
single canto of Ariosto or Tasso, is worth all the Spanish
epic poetry that ever was written.</p>

<p>IV. Of all the poets of modern times, the Spanish
can alone be regarded as the inventors of the poetry
of catholic mysticism, which they have employed in a
very ingenious, though, it must be confessed, not in an
exemplary manner. He must indeed be completely
dazzled by the brilliant side of Spanish poetry, who
refuses to acknowledge that the character of the sacred
comedy is monstrous, even as it appears in the Autos of
the estimable Calderon. But, on the other hand, the
affectation of philosophic criticism must have deadened
all susceptibility for that bold style of spiritual poetry
in him who denies to the Spanish Autos the possession
of beauties, which deserve to be admired. What might
not this poetry have become, had reason extended her
influence over it in a more powerful degree, not, indeed,
to reduce it to the level of prose, but to divest it of the
mask of caricature, while soaring in the lofty regions
of mystic invention!</p>

<p>It has long been a subject of surprise and regret with Foreigners,
and with those of our own countrymen acquainted with their Literature,
that no establishment for the circulation of Books in the FOREIGN
LANGUAGES, should have been formed in this country.</p>

<p>If this opinion was prevalent during the late war, how must it
have gained ground latterly, owing to the gradual increase which, since
that period, Foreign Literature has been making in the number of its
votaries in this country.</p>

<p>With the view of supplying this <i>desideratum</i> in Literature,
<span class="smcap">Boosey</span> and <span class="smcap">Sons</span>, (<i>after an experience of thirty years as Foreign and
English Booksellers</i>,) have been induced, at the particular request of
many of their Friends, who have promised them their support and
patronage, to undertake the establishment of a <span class="smcap">Circulating Library</span>
<i>for</i> <span class="smcap">Foreign Books</span> ONLY, upon an extensive scale.</p>

<p>As it is their intention to spare neither pains nor expence in
rendering it as complete as possible, they confidently hope that it will
meet with the approbation of the Public.</p>

<p>The Catalogue (which is in active preparation) will contain an
extensive Collection of <i>French</i>, <i>German</i>, <i>Italian</i>, <i>Spanish</i>, and <i>Portuguese</i>
books, including the works of the authors in those languages
who are considered as Classic Writers; also an extensive selection
of <i>Modern Publications</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">612</span></p>

<p>In order to be supplied with all New Works of interest on their
<i>first appearance</i>, <span class="smcap">Boosey</span> and <span class="smcap">Sons</span> have made arrangements with their
Correspondents to forward them, together with the best Periodical
Publications, <i>once every month</i>.</p>

<p>The Library will be opened to the Public as soon as the Catalogue,
which is in a great state of forwardness, can be got ready for delivery:
in the mean time a list of the Terms of Subscription is subjoined, in
order that those who feel disposed may have an opportunity of
encouraging the undertaking with their early support and patronage.</p>

This remark, from the <i>Indiculo luminoso</i> of Bishop Alvaro

repeated by Velasquez in his History of Spanish Poetry, Dieze’s
edition, page 33.&mdash;See also Eichhorn’s <i>Allgemeine Geschichte

history of Arabic poetry in Spain cannot be comprehended in a

Velasquez, Dieze, and other authors, furnish information on
the history of the Biscayan language and poetry. This language,
with the poetry to which it may have given birth, has had no influence
on literature beyond its own territory, and appears to have
had very little even there.</p></div>

How sensibly the neglect of the Catalonian or Valencian
tongue, after the union of the kingdoms of Arragon and Castile,
was felt in the provinces which belonged to the former, may be
seen from the passage quoted by Eichhorn, in his <i>Allg. Gesch.
der Cul. u. Litt.</i> vol. i. page 129, from Scuolano’s History
of Valencia. But the pleasing language of the Troubadours was
doubtless very defective. It would otherwise have been difficult
to have made the Catalonian poets so soon proselytes to the Castilian
dialect, especially as, besides the difference of language, the natural
jealousy between the Arragonian and Castilian provinces was
strong enough to manifest itself by political effects even in the
eighteenth century. The imperfection of the Troubadour phraseology
may have been partly owing to its fluctuations, and the
various forms it assumed, in the several dialects. The difference of
the dialects appears particularly evident on comparing the real
<span class="smcap">Provençal</span> of the French Troubadours with the Valencian, called
<span class="smcap">Lengua Vallenciana</span>. The dialect of the Provençal Troubadours
may, without much difficulty, be translated by conjecture, if
the reader be acquainted with French and Italian; but the meaning
of the Valencian cannot be so easily guessed at, even with the additional
knowledge of Castilian. As a proof of this, it will be sufficient
to peruse a passage of the <i>Libre de los Dones</i>, of <i>Mosen</i>, [that is,
Monsieur, instead of the Castilian Don] <i>Jaume</i> [James] <i>Roig</i>,
reprinted in Valencia, 1735, in 4to. The author is one of the last
poets who wrote in the Valencian dialect, and the whole didactic
poem, if so it may be called, is composed in short verses of the
following description:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yo com absent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Del mon vivint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aquell linquint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aconortat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Del apartat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dant hi del peu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vell jubileu<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mort civilment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ja per la gent<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Con hom selvatge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tenint ostatge, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Owing to the difference of the dialects, a foreigner might, by a
short residence in Madrid, learn to express himself in Castilian with
more fluency than it is spoken by a great part of the inhabitants of
the Arragonian provinces.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">8</a>
At least such is the opinion of Gregorio Mayans y Ziscar,
given in his work, known under the title of <i>Origenes de la
Lengua Española</i>, part i. page 8.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">9</a>
An old prejudice attributes the forcible aspiration which the
Spanish shares in common with the German and Arabic, solely to
the mixture of the latter with the Castilian. This prejudice is
pardonable in the Spaniards, who are not aware of the influence
which the German guttural must have had over their language;
but the Germans, who know the nature of their mother tongue,
ought to recollect that the same Arabic words which are strongly
aspirated by the Spaniards, are pronounced by the Portuguese,
though equally naturalized among them, with a hissing sound.
Besides, how does it happen that the <small>G</small> before <small>E</small> and <small>I</small>, which is a
guttural with the Germans, has nearly the same sound with the
Castilians, though it is never so pronounced by any other people
whose language appears to have risen on the ruins of that of ancient
Rome? The Germanic pronunciation of the Visigoths, which was
doubtless preserved in the mountains of Castile, would afterwards
be easily confounded with the Arabic. The Castilian conversion of
<small>O</small> into <small>UE</small>, also resembles the change which takes place in German of
<small>O</small> into <small>OE</small>. Let, for instance, the Spanish <span class="smcap">Cuerpo</span> and <span class="smcap">Pueblo</span>
be compared with the German <span class="smcap">Körper</span> and <span class="smcap">Pöbel</span>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">10</a>
The Portuguese language would perhaps be less depreciated
by the Spaniards, if it did not remind them of the vulgar idiom
spoken by the Galician water-carriers in Madrid. On the contrary,
the Portuguese think the Castilian language inflated, and at the same
time rough and also affected. Both nations are as little disposed
to come to an agreement on the merits of their respective
languages as the Danes and Swedes are regarding theirs; for the
Castilian and Portuguese are, like the Danish and Swedish, only
two conflicting dialects of the same tongue. The Swedes admit
that the Danish language exceeds their own in softness, though
they consider that softness disagreeable, and the harsher Swedish
more sonorous on account of the greater abundance and fulness of
its vowel sounds; thus, precisely in the same manner, do the
Spaniards condemn the softness of the Portuguese tongue. The
elision of the letter <small>L</small> in a great number of Portuguese words, as
in <small>COR</small>, <small>PAÇO</small>, for <i>color</i>, <i>palacio</i>, and the remarkable change of <small>L</small>
into <small>R</small>, as in <i>branco</i>, <i>brando</i>, for <i>blanco</i>, <i>blando</i>, are peculiarities of
that language to which foreigners do not easily reconcile themselves.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">11</a>
The first essay towards a history of the Portuguese language,
and an introduction to Portuguese orthography, were published
in Lisbon at the time when Portugal was a Spanish province.&mdash;Duarte
Nunez de Liaõ, the author of both works, was a
statesman and magistrate. (<i>Desembargador da Camara da
Supplicaçaõ.</i>) The former is entitled <i>Origem da Lingoa Portugueza</i>,
<i>Lisb.</i> 1606, in 8vo. It is dedicated to Philip III. king
of Spain, who is, however, on this occasion merely addressed as
<i>Dom Phelipe II. de Portugal</i>. In the preface the author states
his other, but older work, (<i>Orthographia da Lingoa Portugueza</i>,
Lisb. 1576, in 8vo.) to be the first of the kind. The
Portuguese have, however, for two centuries laboured with as
little success as the Germans, to introduce uniformity of orthography
into their language. The convertible <small>M</small> and <small>AÕ</small> appear to
have been so early selected to denote the French nasal tone which
occurs in numerous final syllables, that Nunez de Liaõ found it
necessary to acquiesce in the custom, according to which the same
word might be very differently written, as <i>naçaõ</i> or <i>naçam</i>, <i>naõ</i> or
<i>nam</i>, pronounced nearly as <i>nassaong</i> and <i>naong</i>, with the French
sound of <i>on</i>, <i>bon</i>. But it surely could not have been very difficult
to dispossess the totally unnecessary and barbarous <small>H</small> in <i>hum</i> and
<i>huma</i> (from the latin <i>unus</i> and <i>una</i>) of the place it had assumed,
as it is now banished from elegant Portuguese orthography. Trifles
of this kind present more materials for reflection than a first view
gives reason to expect. When the orthography of a country continues
to be an object of reform, that nation is deficient in a
certain degree of refinement, the attainment of which has either
been missed, or the right pursuit of which is but just commenced.
Indeed what necessity is there for the French, Italians, Spaniards
and Portuguese, writing the same sound, occurring in the same
word, in four different ways, as for example, <i>bataille</i>, <i>battaglia</i>,
<i>batalla</i>, <i>batalha</i>?</p></div>

Nothing could be more improper than to follow Du Cange,
(Glossar. praef. § 34, sq.) in dividing the <i>vulgare idioma</i> of the
present inhabitants of the Pyrenean Peninsula into the <i>Castellanum</i>,
<i>Limosinum</i>, and <i>Vasconicum</i>.</p></div>

A particular account of the Limosin poetry, even in its
last period, which is late enough to come into the division of time
called the latter ages, does not belong to the history of modern
poetry. It ought to be treated as the last part of the chivalrous
poetry of the middle ages.&mdash;See the notices in Velasquez and
Dieze, p. 45, and the still more instructive sketch of the history of
Limosin poetry, in Eichhorn’s <i>Gesch. der Cult. u. Litt.</i> vol. i.
p. 123.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">14</a>
That the Portuguese and the Galician were originally not to
be distinguished from each other, is expressly stated by that attentive
observer of the forms of his native language, Nunez de Liaõ,
who says, <i>As quaes ambas</i>, (namely, the Portuguese and the Galician
tongues) <i>eraõ antigamente quasi huma mesma nas palavras,
e diphthongos, e pronunciação, que as outras partes de Hespanha
naõ tem</i>. <span class="smcap">Origem da Lingoa Portugueza</span>, cap. VI.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">15</a>
Velasquez, who felt this, thought fit when he read the
<i>Lusiade de Camões</i>, to pay a particular compliment to the author,
at the expense of the Portuguese language; for, after delivering
the same opinion on that language, which is entertained by most
Spaniards, he very elegantly adds: “the muses thought otherwise
when they spoke through the mouth of Camoens.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">16</a>
<i>Cada fuente de Portugal y cada monte son Hippocrenes
y Parnassos</i>, says Manuel de Faria y Sousa, in his <i>Epitome de
las Historias Portugueses</i>. Father Sarmiento, a Spanish author,
whom national prejudice does not prevent from doing justice to
the Portuguese, mentions this observation in his instructive <i>Memorias
para la Poesia Española</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">17</a>
The word is used in this extensive sense by Sarmiento in
his <i>Memorias</i>, or as the book is sometimes called, <i>Obras posthumas</i>,
parte i. p. 168. Authors are far from being agreed
respecting the origin of the term <i>redondillas</i>, (according to the
Portuguese orthography <i>redondilhas</i>.) But is not the word more
naturally derived from <i>redondo</i> (round), than from a small town
called Redondo? Instead of redondillas, these compositions are
sometimes named <i>redondillos</i>, the word <i>versos</i> being understood.
In German they might be called <i>ringelverse</i> (circular verses.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">18</a>
Shall it be said that there is, in the German language, no
kind of verse which unites to so much grace, a character so truly
popular! Let Burger’s <i>Nachtfeier der Venus</i> be considered, before
this be determined. Even the Esthonian Serfs, on the coast
of the Baltic, chaunt their simple ballads in the same measure.
Proof of this may be seen on reference to Petri’s <i>Nachrichten von
den Esthen</i>, vol. ii. p. 69.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">19</a>
Among others, Sarmiento, who in support of this opinion,
quotes some verses from Virgil, for example: <i>Inter viburna cupressi</i>&mdash;<i>Tondenti
barba cadebat</i>, &amp;c. These verses have, it is
true, eight syllables, but not four trochaic feet.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">20</a>
How does it happen that none of the Spanish authors have
taken notice of the ancient songs sung by the Roman soldiers,
though they are evidently <i>redondillas</i>? Suetonius has preserved
some remarkable examples of these songs; and the same
measure occurs after the decline of latin poetry, particularly in
some pious verses of Prudentius, which are quoted by Sarmiento.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">21</a>
After examining Arabic verses, written in the European
manner, it cannot be difficult, even for persons unacquainted with
the language, to form a sufficient idea of the influence which the
monotonic rhymes of the Moors had on the old Castilian romances.
See, for example, the following passage of the Koran:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Va sciamsi, va dhohàha,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Val Kamari eda talàha,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Van nahari, eda giallàha,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Val Laïli eda jagsciàha.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the Spanish ear required some variety, and accordingly preferred
a predominant to a single unchanging rhyme. Thus in the
romance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Media noche era por hilo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Los gallos querian <i>cantar</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Donde Claros con amores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No podia <i>reposar</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quanto muy grandes sospiros<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que el amor se hazia <i>dar</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">22</a>
Such <i>rimas asonantes</i> as occur in the words <i>noble</i> and <i>pone</i>,
<i>dolor</i> and <i>corazon</i>, are easily recognized. But from some old
Spanish romances, it appears that the return of the same consonants
sometimes supplies the place of an assonant rhyme; for
example, when the words <i>baxo</i>, <i>crucifixo</i>, <i>enojo</i>, &amp;c. follow each
other at short intervals.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">23</a>
See what is stated by Sarmiento, p. 191, from an old
letter of the Marquis of Santillana, of which more particular
notice must soon be taken in this work.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">24</a>
The Spanish and Portuguese <i>versos de arte mayor</i> very
much resemble some of the English popular ballads, with regard
to their measure. There is, however, in the rudest of the Spanish
and Portuguese strophes of this kind, more real rhythmus, than
even in the modern popular songs of the English. An old political
song, by Juan de Mena, commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Como, el, que duerme con la pesada,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que quiere y no puede jamas acordar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mas si lo puede á la fin desechar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queda la mente con el desvelada, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">25</a>
Sarmiento has written at sufficient length on the origin of
the Castilian romances, but the information he gives is more
copious than satisfactory. It would require the most laborious
investigation, joined to the highest critical sagacity, to penetrate the
obscurity in which this part of the history of literature is involved.
How indeed can it be ascertained to what age a ballad belongs, the
author of which is unknown, and which, in the progressive improvement
of the language and the national taste, has been, without
scruple, altered by the singers?</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">26</a>
These monuments of old Castilian rhyme were little known
until rescued from oblivion in 1775 by the publication of D. Thomas
Antonio Sanchez’s <i>Coleccion de Poesias Castellanas Anteriores
al siglo XV.</i> a work which in respect to philology is certainly very
meritorious. The collection, however, appears to terminate with
the third volume, (Madrid, 1782), which contains the <i>Poema de
Alexandra Magno</i>. The first volume contains the celebrated letter
of the <i>Marquis de Santillana</i> on the ancient Spanish poetry, which,
for the first time, is printed in that volume, with a commentary by
the publisher, full of philological learning.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">27</a>
For example, in the following passage which Sarmiento
has also quoted; the language, too, differs less from the present
Spanish in this, than in many other parts of the work.</p>

Sarmiento and Sanchez may be consulted respecting those
enquiries. Some notices on the same topics are also to be found
in Velasquez. Had Berceo composed verses on temporal subjects,
it is probable that the Spanish writers would not have disputed
with so much zeal on the merits of his life. It is curious, that the
pious author himself calls his verse prose. The passage runs thus:&mdash;</p>

As this work is as scarce as it is curious, to extract the
whole of the first tale will perhaps be agreeable to the reader.
Fablava un dia el Conde Lucanor con Patronio su Consejero,
en esta manera. Patronio, vos sabedes que yo soy muy caçador, y
he fecho muchas caças nuevas, que nunca fizo otro ome, y aun he
fecho y añadido en los capillos y en las piguelas algunas cosas muy
aprovechosas, que nunca fueron fechas, y aora los que quieren dezir
mal de mi fablan en escarnio en alguna manera, y quando loan al
Cid Ruydias, o al Conde Ferrand Gonzalez, de quantas lides que
fizieron, o al santo y bienaventurado Rey don Ferrando, quantas
buenas conquistas fizo, loan a mi, diziendo que fiz muy buen fecho,
porque añadi aquello en los capillos y en las piguelas. Y porque
yo entiendo, que este alabamiento mas se me torna en denuesto, que
en alabamiento, ruego vos que me a consejedes en que manera faré,
porque no me escarnezcan por la buena obra que fiz. Señor Conde,
dixo Patronio, para que vos sepades lo que vos cumple de fazer
en esto, plazeme ya que sopiessedes lo que contescio a un moro,
que fue Rey de Cordova. El Conde la preguntó como fuera aquello;
Patronio le dixo assi.</p>

<p>Huvo en Cordova un Rey Moro, que huvo nombre Alhaquime,
y como quier que mantenia bien assaz su Reyno, no se trabajó de
fazer otra cosa honrada, nin de gran fama, de las que suelen y deven
fazer los Reyes. Ca non tan solamente son los Reyes tenudos de
guardar sus Reynos, mas los que buenos quieren ser, conviene que
tales obras fagan, porque con derecho acrecienten sus Reynos, y
fagan en guisa, que en su vida sean muy mas loados de las gentes,
y despues de su muerte finqueen buenas fazañas de las obras que
ellos ovieren fecho. E este Rey non se trabajava de esto, si non
de comer, y de folgar, y de estar en su casa vicioso; y acaescio, que
estando un dia que tañian ante el un estormento de que se pagavan
mucho los moros, que há nombre Albogon, e el Rey paró mientes,
y entendio que non fazia tan buen son como era menester, y tomó
el Albogon, y añadio en el un forado a la parte de yuso, en derecho
de los otros forados, y dende en adelante fazia el Albogon muy
mejor son que fasta entonces fazia. E comoquiera que aquello
era bien fecho para en aquella cosa, pero que non era tan gran fecho
como convenia de fazer al Rey. E las gentes en manera de escarnio
començaron a loar aquel fecho, y dezian quando llamavan a alguno
en Arabigo, <i>Vahedezut Alhaquime</i>, que quiere dezir: este es el
añadimiento del Rey Alhaquime. Esta palabra fue sonada tanto
por la tierra, fasta que lo ovo de oir el Rey, y preguntó, porque
dezian las gentes aqueste palabra. E conaquier que ge lo quisieran
negar y encubrir, tanto los afincó, que ge lo ovieron a dezir. E
desque esto oyó tomó ende gran peçar, pero como era muy buen
Rey, non quiso fazer mal a los que dezian aquesta palabra, mas
puso en su coraçon de facer otro añadimiento, de que por fuerza
oviessen las gentes a loar el su fecho. E entonce porque la su
mezquita de Cordova non era acabada, añadio en ella aquel Rey
toda la labor que hi menguava, y acabóla. Y esto fue la mejor, y
mas complida, y mas noble mesquita que los moros avian en España.
E loado Dios es aora Iglesia, y llamanla Santa Maria de Cordova,
y ofresciola el santo Rey don Fernando a Santa Maria quando ganó
a Cordova de los Moros. E desque aquel Rey ovo acabado la
mesquita, y fecho aquel tan buen añadimiento, dixo, que pues
fasta entonces lo avian a escarnio, retrayendole del añadimiento que
fiziera en el Albogon, que tenia que de alli adelante le avrian a
loar con razon del añadimiento que fiziera en la mezquita de Cordova,
y fue despues muy loado: y el loamiento que fasta entonces
le fazian escarnesciendole, fincò despues por loa, y oy dia dizen los
Moros quando quieren loar algun buen hecho:&mdash;Este es el añadimiento
del Rey Alhaquime. E vos, Señor Conde, si tomades pesar,
o cuidades que vos loan por escarnescer del añadimiento, que
fezistes en los capillos, y en las piguelas, y en las otras cosas de
caça que vos fezistes, guisad de fazer algunos fechos granados e
nobles que les pertenesce de facer a los grandes omes. E por
fuerça las gentes avran de loar los vuestros buenos fechos, assi
como loan aora por escarnio en el añadimiento que fezistes de la
caça. E el Conde tovo este por buen consejo y fizolo assí, e fallose
dello muy bien. E porque don Juan entendio que esta era buen
exemplo, fizolo escrivir en este libro, y fizo estos versos, que
dizen assi:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Si algun bien fizieres, que chico asaz fuere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fazlo granado, que el bien nunca muere.<br /></span>

Argote y Molina enumerates the prose works of this prince in
the before-mentioned biography. He notices the poems in an
appendix to his edition of <i>El Conde Lucanor</i>, entitled <i>Discurso
sobre la poesia Española</i>. Though the appendix occupies only a
few pages, it contains many interesting observations.</p></div>

The following romance, which is inserted without interpunctuation,
as it appears in the original, may serve for a specimen
of those to which the name of Don Juan Manuel is attached. It is
certainly not the worst of its kind; and must have found its way by
some lucky accident into the <i>Cancionero general</i>, which contains
scarcely any narrative romances. It is also found in another
<i>Cancionero de Romances</i>, under the title of <i>Romance de Don
Juan Manuel</i>.</p>

<p>All the songs attributed to Don Juan Manuel in the <i>Cancionera</i>
have a form and structure, which render it probable that they belong
to the age in which <i>El Conde Lucanor</i> was written; one, for
example, begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quien por bien servir alcanza<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vivir triste y desamado,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Que le traera este cuydado<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mayor mal.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another which belongs to the class, called <i>Villancios</i> possesses
more poetical merit. It commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Muerto es ya, muerto, Señora,<br /></span>

As a specimen by which justice will be done the author, it

Velasquez. Don Amor says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

The celebrated letter of the Marquis de Santillana, which
must be more particularly noticed hereafter, contributes its part in
illustrating the history of this period. Much however is not to be
learned from the letter itself. The commentary on it by Sanchez,
in the first volume of the before-mentioned <i>Coleccion</i>, is far more
instructive.</p></div>

Whoever wishes to become acquainted with the controversies
on the early literature of knight-errantry, should resort to Nicolas
Antonio, and compare what he says with Eichhorn’s learned view
of the subject, including the necessary references, in his Allg.
Gesch. der Cult. u. Litt. Theil I. p. 136, &amp;c. Nunez de Liaõ, in
his <i>Origem de Lingoa Portugueza</i>, also mentions Lobeira as
the author of <i>Amadis de Gaul</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">49</a>
The merit of the Amadis was not overlooked by Cervantes.
In the judgment passed on Don Quixote’s library, the Curate wishes
to condemn this work first of all to the flames, because, being the
parent of all the books of knight-errantry in Spain, it was therefore
the great cause of Don Quixote’s malady; but the Barber, or
rather Cervantes, speaking in that character, says, “No, friend;
for I have heard it remarked that the Amadis is the <i>best book</i>
of the kind ever written; it ought therefore to be spared as a
<i>peculiar specimen</i> of art.” Whoever may be desirous of making
the Amadis re-appear in a state capable of being relished in the
present times, must, above all things, take care to preserve the ingenuous
simplicity of the stile, or the work will be wholly disfigured.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">50</a>
The titles of all the collections of romances need not be
given here. A considerable part of them may be found in Velasquez,
with additions by Dieze, (p. 442, &amp;c.) and Blankenburg’s
Zusätzen zu Sulzer’s Wörterbuche. I have before me several
collections, which contain some of the oldest romances I am
acquainted with. The best of these collections is entitled: <i>Cancionero
de Romances, en que estan recopilados la mayor parte
de los Romances Castellanos, que hasta agora se han compuesto.</i>
Nuevamento corregido <i>y añadido en muchos partes. Anvers</i>
1555, 8vo. In the well known <i>Romancero general</i> none of the
pieces which derive their materials from knight-errantry romances
are to be found.</p></div>

According to Sarmiento (p. 228,) it is usual to say, <i>Este
no vale las coplas de Calainos</i>. But it is not therefore to be
inferred, that the ancient romance of that name is the worst of
the kind.</p></div>

It will be sufficient to cite, in support of this opinion, the
romance of the <i>Conde Alarcos</i>, which is, besides, distinguished
from most of the other romances by greater richness of composition.
It opens in a very simple manner with a description of the
sorrow of the Infante Solesa, who, after being secretly betrothed to
Count Alarcos, has been abandoned by him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Retraida està la Infanta<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bien assi como salia,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Viviendo muy descontenta<br /></span>
<span class="i2">De la vida que tenia,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vienda ya que se pasava<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Toda la flor de su vida.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The fair Infanta midst the court<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A look of sorrow wears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told by an aching heart how she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is doom’d to pass her years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For far from her is ever flown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The early bloom of life&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At length, after Count Alarcos has been long married, the forsaken
princess discloses her seduction to her father. This scene
is strongly painted, but not overcharged: the king is transported
by rage and indignation; his honour appears to him so wounded,
that nothing but the death of the Countess can be a sufficient satisfaction.
He has an interview with the Count, addresses him
courteously, represents the case to him with chivalrous dignity as a
point of justice and honour, and concludes by categorically demanding
the death of his lady. Thus the developement of the story commences
in a manner, which, though most singular, is perhaps not
unnatural, when the ideas of the age to which the composition belongs
are considered. The Count conceives himself bound as a man
of honour to give the king the satisfaction he desires. He promises
to comply with his demand, and proceeds on his way home. There
is a touching simplicity in the picture which is here drawn.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Llorando se parte el Conde,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Llorando, sin alegria,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Llorando a la Condessa,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Lloraba tambien el Conde<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Por tres hijos que tenia,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">El una era de teta,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Que la Condessa lo cria,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Que no queria mamar<br /></span>
<span class="i2">De tres amas, que tenia,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sino era de su madre.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Weeping he homeward wends his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His grief nought can remove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because his tears are shed for her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He more than life doth love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He weepeth too for his three sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In youth and beauty dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youngest boy a suckling still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Countess’ self doth rear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, save his mother, none he lov’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he had nurses three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor by the milk of other breasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would alimented be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The pathetic interest now rises gradually to the highest pitch
of tragic horror. The Countess, who receives her husband with
the wonted marks of affection, in vain enquires the cause of his
melancholy. He sits down to supper with his family, and again we
have a situation painted with genuine feeling, though with little art.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Sentose el Conde a la mesa,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No cenava, ni podia,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">De lagrimas de sus ojos<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The board is laid, he takes his place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where viands tempt in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For near him his lov’d children are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now lov’d, alas! with pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In seeming sleep with head reclin’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tries to hide his woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from his eyes the big tears roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er the table flow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The apparent fatigue of the Count induces the Countess to
accompany him to his apartment. When they enter, the Count
fastens the door, relates what has passed, and desires his lady to
prepare for death.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">De morir aveis, Condessa,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Antes que amenesca el dia.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Countess, thou art doom’d to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the morning’s dawn.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She begs him to spare her only for her children’s sake. The
Count desires her to embrace for the last time the youngest, whom
she has brought with her into the room asleep in her arms.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Abrazad este chiquito,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Que aquesto es el que os perdia.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Peso me de vos, Condessa,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quanta pesar me podia.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Give to that babe one parting kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That babe for whom thou’rt lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beshrew me&mdash;but I pity thee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I who need pity most.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She submits to her hard fate, and only asks for time to say an
<i>ave maria</i>. The Count desires her to be quick. She falls on her
knees, and pours forth a brief but fervent prayer; she then requests
a few moments more delay, that she may once more give suck to
her infant son. What modern poet would have thought of introducing
so exquisite a touch of nature? The Count forbids her to
wake the child. The unfortunate lady forgives her husband, but
predicts that, within thirty days, the king and his daughter will be
summoned before the tribunal of the Almighty. The Count
strangles her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Echole por la garganta<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Una toca que tenia,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Apreto con los dos manos,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Con la fuerza que podia.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No le afloxo la garganta,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mentre que vida tenia.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the conclusion, the fulfilment of the unfortunate Countess’s
prophecy is briefly related. On the twelfth day the princess died,
on the twentieth the king, and on the thirtieth the Count himself
expired.</p></div>

<i>No vale las coplas de la Sarabanda</i>, is a proverb of precisely
the same signification as&mdash;<i>No vale las coplas de Calainos</i>,
according to Sarmiento. See the remark, page 55. The two

Calainos is not in coplas.</p></div>

“Fizo <i>assaz buenas</i> canciones,” says the Marquis of Santillana,
in his antiquated Spanish, speaking of his grandfather. The
remaining notices which he gives of the origin of Spanish
poetry communicate nothing, in addition to what has been already
mentioned, on those things respecting which it is most
desirable to be informed.</p></div>

An extract made from this treatise of the Marquis of Villena
by Gregorio Mayans, may be found in the <i>Origines de la lengua
Española</i>, tom. ii. pag. 321. The whole work probably exists in
manuscript in Spanish libraries.</p></div>

the Chronicles, from which he had drawn his information respecting
the Marquis of Santillana.</p></div>

This elegy is inserted along with other poems by the

works of this celebrated man has yet been printed.</p></div>

Thus the two following stanzas are crowded with the
names of authors, ancient and modern, with the view of shewing
the loss which Spanish literature had sustained by the death of
Villena.</p>

Stanzas, like the following, deserve to be extracted from
this work, as they are calculated to shew what might have been
expected of the Marquis of Santillana, had he cultivated his talent

Dieze, in his remarks on Velasquez, erroneously refers to
the publication of Gregorio Mayans, for the proverbs in verse;
but only the original proverbs, without versification, (refranes que
dicen las viejas tras el huego) as collected by the Marquis, are
given in the second volume of that work, p. 179. The greater
part deserve to be better known, but many of them are unintelligible
to foreigners.</p></div>

He appeals to St. Isidore, whom he cites as a guarantee for
this origin of poetry:&mdash;Isidro Cartaginès, santo Arzobispo Hispalense,

rythmos y cantó en metro hay sido Moysen, y despues Joshue,
David, Salomon, y Job.</p></div>

Only the supplement to this poem is contained in the <i>Cancionero
general</i>. The poem itself was probably too long to be
included in that collection. However, in the editions of the collected
works of Mena (for instance, that which I have now before
me, intitled&mdash;<i>Todas las obras del famosissimo poeta Juan de
Mena, &amp;c.</i> Anveres, 1552, 8º) which Dieze notices, it fills the
greater portion of the volume, and is accompanied by a copious
commentary by Fernan Nuñez.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="label">89</a>
The emphatic praise bestowed on this poem in Dieze’s
observations on Velasquez, (page 168), according to which Juan
de Mena “maintains <i>to his advantage</i> a comparison with all the
poets of all ages,” is sufficient to prove Dieze’s deficiency in sound
criticism.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">90</a>
The second stanza contains the theme, but it is very imperfectly
expressed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tus casos fallaces, Fortuna, cantamos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Estados de gentes que giras y trocas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tus muchas mudanzas, tus firmezas pocas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Y las que en tu rueda quexosos hallamos.<br /></span>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="label">91</a>
Mena, politely enough, solicits permission of Fortune to read
her a lesson:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dame licencia, mudable Fortuna,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Porque yo blasme de ti lo que devo.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Then, in well turned antitheses, he allows her a sort of regularity
which contradicts itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Que tu firmeza es, no ser constante,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tu temperamento es destemplanza,<br /></span>

Providence appears as a most beautiful young woman:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Otras beldades loar de mayores.<br /></span>

In the fourth stanza a patriotic flight seems to promise the
recurrence of similar passages:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Como que creo, que fossen menores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que los Africanos, los hechos del Cid?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ni que feroces menos en la lid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entrassen los nuestros que los Agenores? &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
On another occasion the author addresses an invocation to his
native city Cordova:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O flor de saber y cabelleria,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cordova madre, tu hijo perdona,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si en los cantares, que agora pregona,<br /></span>

When the poet, in his ideal world, sees Don Alvaro, by a singular
fancy he pretends not to know him, in order that he may
question his guide (Providence) respecting him, in imitation of a
similar passage in Homer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tu, Providencia, declara de nuevo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quien es aquel Caballero, que veo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que mucho en el cuerpo parece a Tydeo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E en consejo a Nestor el longevo.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Among other things Providence replies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Este cavalga sobre la Fortuna<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Y doma su cuello con asperas riendas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Y aunque del tenga tan muchas deprendas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ella no le osa tocar de ninguna.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Miralo, miralo en platica alguna,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Con humildes, no tanto feroces!<br /></span>

In the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spanish books
were printed in Seville by German printers. At the end of an
edition, probably the first, of the proverbs collected by the Marquis
of Santillana, (<a href="#Page_88">see page 88</a>,) are the following words, which Mayans
y Siscar has reprinted:&mdash;Aqui se acaben los refranes&mdash;imprimidos
en la muy noble y leal civdad de Sevilla por Jacobo Comberger,
Aleman, año 1508.</p></div>

An accurate idea of all the romances of this class may be
derived from the <i>Historia de los Vandos de los Zegris y Abencerrages,
Caballeros Moros de Granada</i>, a work well known to
those who are acquainted with Spanish literature. It has been
several times printed. The edition which I have now before me
(Lisboa 1616,) seems to be one of the latest. On the title page
the author styles himself, Ginez Perez de Hita, and on that page
also appear the words, <i>Aora nuevamente sacado de un libro
Arabigo</i>. The German critic Blankenburgh, is of opinion, that there
is no more reason for supposing this work to be a translation from the
Arabic, than that Don Quixote was derived from a similar source.
But the word <i>sacado</i> on the title page, by no means indicates that
it is a translation. The author has evidently derived much of his
information, such for instance, as the genealogical register of the
families, from Moorish sources. He has probably availed himself
of an Arabic work to write a half true and half fabulous history of
Granada, and to intersperse it with favourite romances. There
is a counterfeit edition of this work, entitled, <i>Historia de las
guerras civiles de Granada, Paris</i>, 1660. From the French
words on the margin, it is obvious that the book must have been used
in Paris in the seventeenth century, for learning the Spanish language.</p></div>

Nicolas Antonio, Sarmiento, and Velasquez, give accounts of
Juan de la Enzina. Some of his romances and songs, which
however, possess no remarkable merit, are also contained in the
<i>Cancionero general</i> and the <i>Cancionero de romances</i>. One of
his compositions, styled an <i>echo</i>, or a song, in which the rhyme is
repeated in the following word, with the effect of an echo, is
inserted in the <i>Cancionero general</i>, as being something peculiar.
The old collection, entitled, <i>Cancionero de todas las obras de Juan
del Enzina</i>, certainly contains poems far superior to any already
mentioned, though perhaps they do not rise above the poetry of his
age. Velasquez quotes an edition published in 1516, which Dieze
regards as a curiosity. Indeed one of the greatest literary curiosities
in existence, is an old folio edition, (probably the first) of the
<i>Cancionero</i> of Juan de la Enzina, printed at Seville, in gothic
characters, in the year 1501, by two Germans named Pegnitzer and
Herbst, at the expense of two merchants. The copy to which I
have referred, which is probably the only one in Germany, is also
mentioned in Dieze’s supplement to Velasquez; it belongs to the
Ducal library at Wolfenbüttel. Notwithstanding the gothic characters,
the print is so clear and neat, that in this respect alone it
is highly interesting to bibliographists. Juan de la Enzina’s songs
occupy the greater part of the volume. One of them, namely&mdash;an
Apology for Women, (<i>Contra los que dicen mal de Mugeres</i>) is
remarkable for poetic truth and pleasing versification. In this
Apology for the fair sex, the author, among other things, says:</p>

<p>His imitations of Virgil’s eclogues have the same metrical
form as many of his other poems. The first eclogue commences
with the following graceful strophe:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Tityro, tu sin cuidado<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que te estas so aqueste haya,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yo triste y descarriado<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yo no sè, por do me vaya.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tañes tu tu caramillo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hay que en cordoja te trayga.<br /></span>

<p>
His sacred and profane pastoral dramas are merely eclogues in
a style similar to the above, only that they are written in the dialogue
form, and with remarkable lightness. The last, which is of the
profane class, commences thus:&mdash;</p>

The dramatic romance of Callistus and Melibœa, has been

There is an old German translation which appeared at Nurnberg in
1520, entitled the <i>Hurenspiegel</i>. The German philologist, Caspar
Barth, translated it into Latin under the title of <i>Pornoboscodidascalus</i>,
and styles it, <i>Liber plane divinus</i>. It was published at
Frankfort on the Oder, in 1624.</p></div>

One may become acquainted with these old Spanish chronicles
with more facility than formerly; for during the last thirty
years the greater part of them have been re-printed. A folio
edition of the copious chronicle of Peres de Guzman was printed
at Valencia, in the year 1779, with an elegance which proves the
patriotic zeal of the editors: the chronicle of Ayala was printed at
Madrid in the same year. Literature is indebted for this revival
of the fathers of Spanish History, to the efforts of the Historical
Academy of Madrid.</p></div>

The author thus relates how in his youth Don Alvaro de
Luna, by the irresistible grace of his manners had gained the love
of the king, who was then also very young, and the favour of
the fair sex:&mdash;</p>
<p>
Ca si Rey salia á danzar, non queria que otro caballero ninguno,
nin grande nin Rico ome danzase con él, salvo Don Alvaro
de Luna, nin queria con otro cantar, nin facer cosa, salvo con Don
Alvaro, nin se apartaba con otro á aver sus consejos é fablas
secretas tanto como con él. De la otra parte que todas las dueñas
é doncellas lo favorescian mucho. Don Alvaro era mas mirado é
preciado entre todos aquellos que en las fiestas se ayuntaron. E
despues quando el Rey se retraìa á su cámara á burlar ó aver placer,
Don Alvaro burlaba tan cortés é graciosamente, que el Rey é
todos los otros que con él eran avian muy grand placer. E si
fablaban en fechos de caballeria, aunque Don Alvaro era mozo,
él fablaba en ellos, assi bien é atentamente que todos se maravillaban.
E aquel fué desde niño su mayor estudio, entender en los
fechos de armas é de caballeria, é darse á ellos, é saber en ellos
mas facer que decir.</p></div>

Verdad es que da muchas consolaciones: y cuenta muchos loores
de la vejez. Pero no provee de remedio para sus males. Quisiere
yo fallar un remedio solo, mas por cierto de Señor fisico que todos
sus consolaciones por que el conorte quando no quita dolor, no pone
consolacion. Quise ver essomismo el segundo libro que fizo de las
quistiones Tosculanas. Do quiere provar que el sabio no deve haver
dolor: y si lo hoviere lo puede desechar con virtud. E yo Señor
dotor como no soy sabio senti el dolor. Y como no soy virtuoso no
le puede desechar. Ni lo desechara el mismo Julio por virtuoso que
fuera: si sintiera el mal que yo sinti. Assi que para las enfermedades
que vienen con la vejez fallo que es mejor yr al fisico
remediador: que al filosofo consolador. Por los Cipiones, por
los Metellos, y sabios, y por los Trasos, y por otros algunos romanos
que bivieron y murieron en honra quiere provar Julio que la vejez
es buena. Y por algunos que ovieron mala postremera provare yo
que es mala. E dare mayor numero de testigos para prueva de mi
intencion que el Señor Julio pudo dar para en prueva de la suya.</p></div>

An unpardonable neglect of chronology has given rise to a
confusion of dates, by which this period of Spanish literature has
been made to include two distinct epochs. This confusion is particularly
striking in the work of Velasquez. In his third age of
Castilian poetry, which he commences with the introduction of the
Italian style, but which ought really to be called the second, he
reckons all the Spanish poets, who appear to have formed their
manner after Italian models down to the reign of Philip IV.; and in
the following age, which he calls the fourth, he places Virnes, Lope
de Vega, and others, who flourished half a century before.</p></div>

<span class="i0">En este dulce error muero contento;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Porque ver claro, y conocer mi estado<br /></span>

In the title of the edition which I have perused of his <i>Obras</i>,
(Madrid, 1610, in 4to.) the word “Hurtado” is omitted, and he is
called simply Diego de Mendoza; but the Mendozas are so numerous
in Spanish literature, that it is necessary to pay attention to all
the distinctions in their names.</p></div>

Words on which elisions are permitted in Italian, as for
example, <i>dar</i>, <i>legger</i>, <i>amor</i>, <i>peggior</i>, instead of <i>dare</i>, <i>leggere</i>,
<i>amore</i>, <i>peggiore</i>, are in Spanish, by an invariable rule of the language,
written <i>dar</i>, <i>leèr</i>, <i>amor</i>, <i>peòr</i>; and, on the other hand, no
poet can presume to omit the terminating vowels in Spanish words.
A succession of pure feminine rhymes is, therefore, as unnatural in
the Spanish language as in the German. In the Spanish, however,
the unnatural effect is easily concealed; while in the German, the
incessant recurrence of the semi-mute <i>e</i>, in feminine rhymes, is
intolerable.</p></div>

A new edition of this work, which is entitled:&mdash;<i>Guerra de

<p>
Bien sè que muchas cosas de las que escriviere pareceràn a
algunos livianas, i menudas para Historia, comparadas a las grandes,
que de España se hallan escritas; Guerras largas de varios sucesos,
tomas i desolaciones de Ciudades populosas, Reyes vencidos i presos,
discordias entre padres i hijos, hermanos i hermanas, suegros i
hiernos, desposeidos, restituidos, i otra vez desposeidos, muertos a
hierro, acabados linages, mudadas successiones de Reinos; libre i
estendido campo, i ancha salida para los Escritores. Yo escogi
camino mas estrecho, trabajoso, esteril, i sin gloria; pero provechoso,
i de fruto para los que adelante vinieren; comienzos bajos,
rebelion de salteadores, junta de esclavos, tumulto de villanos, competencias,
odios, ambiciones, i pretensiones; dilacion de provisiones,
falta de dinero, inconvenientes o no creidos, o tenidos en poco.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_187" href="#FNanchor_187" class="label">187</a>
For example:</p>
<p>
Porque la Inquisicion los comenzò a apretar mas de lo ordinario.
El Rei les mandò dejar la habla Morisca, i con ella el
comercio i comunicacion entre si; quitòseles el servicio de los
Esclavos negros a quienes criavan con esperanzas de hijos, el habito
Morisco en que tenian empleado gran caudal; obligaronlos a vestir
Castellano con mucha costa, que las mugeres trugesen los rostros
descubiertos, que las casas acostumbradas a estar cerradas estuviesen
abiertas: lo uno i lo otro tan grave de sufrir entre gente
celosa. Huvo fama que les mandavan tomar los hijos, i pasallos a
Castilla. Vedaronles el uso de los baños, que eran su limpieza i
entrenimiento; primero les havian prohibido la Musica, cantares,
fiestas, bodas, conforme a su costumbre, i qualesquier juntas de
pasatiempo. Saliò todo esto junto sin guardia, ni provision de
gente; sin reforzar presidios viejos, o firmar otros nuevos.</p></div>

This speech is forcibly written, and the style is no where
disfigured by rhetorical ornament. The following is one of its most
powerful passages:&mdash;</p>
<p>
Quien quita que el hombre de Lengua Castellana no pueda
tener la lei del Profeta? i el de la lengua Morisca la lei de Jesus?
llaman a nuestros hijos a sus Congregaciones i casas de letras,
enseñanles artes que nuestros mayores prohibieron aprenderse;
porque no se confundiese la puridad, i se hiciese litigiosa la verdad
de la lei. Cada hora nos amenazan quitarlos de los brazos de sus
madres, i de la crianza de sus padres, i pasarlos a tierras agenas;
donde olviden nuestra manera de vida, i aprendan a ser enemigos de
los padres que los engendramos, i de las madres que los parieron.
Mandannos dejar nuestro habito, vestir el Castellano. Vistense
entre ellos los Tudescos de una manera, los Franceses de otra, los
Griegos de otra, los Frailes de otra, los mozos de otra, i de otra los
viejos; cada Nacion, cada profesion i cada estado usa su manera de
vestido, i todos son Christianos; i nosotros Moros, porque vestimos a
la Morisca; como si truxesemos la lei en el vestido, i no en el corazon.</p></div>

Demàs desto proveerse de vitualla, eligir lugar en la montaña

tiempo tenian escondidas, comprar nuevas, i avisar de nuevo a los
Reyes de Argel, Fez, Señor de Tituan desta resolucion i preparaciones.</p></div>

In the year 1737, that excellent critic Mayans, in allusion
to Diego de Mendoza’s <i>Guerra de Granada</i>, observes:&mdash;Deve
leerse, como el la escriviò. Quiere Dios que algun dia la publique
yo! (<i>Orig. de la Lingua Española</i>, vol. i. p. 205). Thus even at
that period a genuine edition, such as Mayans wished to superintend,
could not be published.</p></div>

Dieze, it is true, alledges the contrary, in his notes on Velasquez;
but it appears that he was acquainted only with the pastoral
poems, and not with the other works of Saa de Miranda.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_192" href="#FNanchor_192" class="label">192</a>
These Spanish pastoral poems are mingled indiscriminately
with the Portuguese poems of the same author, in the neatly printed
edition of the <i>Obras do Doctor Francisco de Sà de Miranda,
Lisboa</i>, 1784, in 2 vols. 8vo. No attention has been paid to the
correction of the Spanish poems in this collection, and Portuguese
words continually occur in them; for example, <i>as</i> for <i>las</i>, <i>pensamentos</i>
for <i>pensamientos</i>, <i>outro</i> for <i>otro</i>, &amp;c. The orthography of
the title-page is uncommon; for in other cases the Portuguese
spelling is not <i>doctor</i>, but <i>doutor</i>, and <i>Sà</i> is a modern substitution
for <i>Saa</i>.</p></div>

For example:&mdash;</p>
<p>
Considerava que sus servicios eran sin esperança de galardon,
cosa que a quien tuviera menos firmeza pudiera facilmente atajar el
camino de sus amores. Mas era tanta su constancia, que puesta
en medio de todas las causas la que tenia de olvidar a quien no se
acordava del, salia tan a su salvo dellas, y tan sin prejuyzio del
amor que a su pastora tenia, que sin miedo alguno acometia qualquiera
imaginacion que en daño de su fe le sobreviniesse. Pues
como vio à Sireno junto à la fuente quedo muy espantado de verle
assi tan triste: no porque el ignorasse la causa de su tristeza, mas
porque le parecio que si el huviera recebido el mas pequeño favor
que Sireno algun tiempo recibio de Diana, aquel contentamiento
bastara para toda la vida tenerle.</p></div>

Venian armados de cosseletes, y celadas de cuero de tigre:&mdash;eran

por braçaletes unas bocas de serpientes, por donde sacavan los
braços, que gruessos y vellosos parecian: y las celadas venian a
hazer encima de la frente unas espantables cabeças de leones. Lo
de mas trayan desnudo, cubierto de espesso y largo vello, unos
bastones herrados de muy agudas puntas de azero. Trayan al
cuello sus arcos y flechas: los escudos eran de unas conchas de
pescado muy fuerte.</p></div>

En estos casos de amor tengo yo una regla, que siempre la he

delicado, en esto del querer bien, lleva grandissima ventaja
al que no lo es. Porque como el amor sea virtud, y la virtud
siempre haga assiento en le mejor lugar, esta claro que las personas
de suerte seran muy mejor enamorades que aquellas à quien esta
falta.</p></div>

<span class="i0">En los desiertos cercos de mis ojos;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que el ayre entretexido con olores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Halaga, y ledo mueve en dulce afeto;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Y de estos mis enojos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destierra, manso sueño, los despojos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ven pues, amado sueño, ven liviano,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que del rico oriente<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despunta el tierno Febo el rayo cano.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ven ya, sueño clemente,<br /></span>

The following is the original Spanish of the passage here
cited, with a part of the continuation, which is all in the same
style:&mdash;</p>
<p>
Conviene que la elegia sea candida, blanda, tierna, suave,
delienda, tersa, clara i, si con esto se puede declarar, noble, congoxosa
en los afetos, i que los mueva en toda parte, ni mui
hinchada, ni mui umilde, no oscura con esquisitas sentencias i
fabulas mui buscadas; que tenga frequente comiseracion, quexas,
esclamaciones, apostrofos, prosopopeyas, escursos o parébases, el
ornato della à de ser mas limpio i reluziente, que peinado i compuesto
curiosamente i porque los escritores de versos amorosos o
esperan, o desesperan, o deshazen sus pensamientos, i induzen otros
nuevos, i los mudan i pervierten, o ruegan, o se quexan, o alegran,
o alaban la hermosura de su dama, o esplican su propria vida, i
cuentan sus fortunas con los demas sentimientos del animo, que ellos
declaran en varias ocasiones; conviniendo que este genero de poesia
sea misto, que aora habla el poeta, aora introduze otra persona.</p></div>

There is a life of Luis de Leon, prefixed to the latest edition
of his <i>Obras propias y traducciones</i> (Valencia, 1762, 8vo.) by
Mayans y Siscar; it is, however, confusedly and carelessly written.
The biographical memoir prefixed to the sixth volume of the
<i>Parnaso Español</i> is better.</p></div>

Apartado no solo de la conversacion y compañia de los
hombres, sino tambien de la vista, por casi cinque años estuve
cercado en una carcel y en tinieblas. Entonces gozava yo de tal
quietud y alegria de animo, que agora muchas vezes echo menos,
aviendo sido restituido a la luz, y gozando del trato de los hombres,
que me son amigos.</p></div>

probably one of the earliest fruits of the youthful piety of the poet.</p></div>

The only unadulterated source from which all authors have
hitherto derived their information relative to the earliest history of
the Spanish drama, is Cervantes’s well known preface to his <i>Ocho
Comedias y Entremeses</i>, an edition of which was published in
two vols. quarto, by Blas Nasarre, at Madrid, in 1749. To this
may be added the preface of the editor, Blas Nasarre, though it is
but of secondary value, and has given occasion to singular mistakes.
The article <i>Comödie</i>, in Blankenburg’s appendix to Sulzer’s dictionary,
though rather obscure, communicates some useful facts.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_277" href="#FNanchor_277" class="label">277</a>
Velasquez, in his History of Spanish Poetry, alludes but
very distantly to the heterogeneous nature of the Spanish dramas;
and Dieze is not more satisfactory in his Remarks. What is contained
in Flögel’s History of Comic Literature, vol. iv. respecting
the origin of the Spanish drama, is copied from Velasquez and other
modern writers. Signorelli has more novelty of information in
his <i>Storia Critica de Teatri</i>, vol. iv. but he confounds the notices
one with another, and reasons on the Spanish drama merely as a
moral critic.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_284" href="#FNanchor_284" class="label">284</a>
This collection of the plays and other poems of Naharro is
mentioned by Nicolas Antonio, and also by Dieze. I have never
seen it: and in the numerous collections of Spanish dramas by
various authors, with which I am acquainted, I have sought in vain
for the productions of Naharro. Blankenburg speaks of them as
if he had read them; and Signorelli expressly says, that he has
perused them all. Among the passages quoted by the latter, in
order to justify the contemptuous tone in which he criticises the
writings of Naharro, is a line of corrupt Portuguese. May not
this be Galician? The modern comic writers of Spain occasionally
make their clowns converse in the Galician dialect.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_285" href="#FNanchor_285" class="label">285</a>
Cervantes attributes to himself the invention of dividing
a drama into three <i>jornadas</i>. How happens this? Cervantes was
a vain man, but not an empty boaster. He seems to have been
totally unacquainted with the dramas of Naharro, but he might
have heard of the division of plays into three <i>jornadas</i>, without
retaining a distinct recollection of the fact. In this way his memory
may have deceived him, when he supposed that the division originated
with himself. And yet it is singular enough that in his
Galathea, he mentions, among other poets, the <i>artificioso Torres
Naharro</i>.</p></div>

Concerning these collections, see Dieze’s Remarks on Velasquez,

por el excellente poeta, y gracioso representante Lope de Rueda,
sacados a luz por Juan Timoneda; Sevilla</i> 1576, in small octavo,
printed in gothic characters. The other is entitled: <i>Las segundas
dos Comedias de Rueda</i>, without date, but printed in the same
type and form as the first mentioned collection.</p></div>

This piece of silly adulation, is entitled <i>Hesperodia</i>; that is
to say, evening song or morning song. The former, however,
appears to be the more appropriate title, since the author doubtless
wrote it in his old age. It has been drawn from the obscurity in
which it ought to have remained, and printed in the eighth vol. of
the Parnaso Español. Bermudez, in an affected strain of language,
and with true Dominican fanaticism, extols the monstrous barbarity
with which the great Duke of Alba persecuted the heretics of the
Netherlands, and made “the cold northern waters flow the more
fiercely from the infusion of warm blood.”</p></div>

For example:&mdash;</p>
<p>
<i>Aur.</i> Bien veo, Antonio, que ai essos provechos que dices de
la soledad: pero yo tengo creido, que otra causa mayor ai. <i>Ant.</i>
Que causa puede aver mayor? <i>Aur.</i> El aborrecimento, que cada
hombre tiene al genero humano, por el qual somos inclinados a
apartarnos unos de otros. <i>Ant.</i> Tan aborrecibles te parecen los
hombres, que aun ellos mesmos por huir de sì, busquen la soledad?
<i>Aur.</i> Pareceme tanto, que cada vez que me acuerdo, que soi hombre,
querria, o no aver sido, o no tener sentimiento dello. <i>Ant.</i>
Maravillome, Aurelio, que los autores excelentes, que acostumbras
a leer, i los sabios hombres, que conversas, no te ayan quitado de
esse error.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_311" href="#FNanchor_311" class="label">311</a>
As for instance in the annexed passage:&mdash;</p>
<p>
Assi que todos estos i los demas estados de los hombres no
son sino diversos modos de penar, do ningun descanso tienen, ni
seguridad en alguno dellos: porque la fortuna todos los confunde, i
los revuelve con vanas esperanzas i vanos semblantes de honras i
riquezas, en las quales cosas mostrando quan facil es i quan incierta,
a todos mete en desseos de valer, tan desordenados, que no ai lugar
tan alto, do los queramos dejar. Con estos escarnios de fortuna
cada uno aborrece su estado con codicia de los otros; do si llega, no
halla aquel reposo que pensaba. Porque todos los bienes de fortuna
al dessear parecen hermosos, i al gozar llenos de pena.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_312" href="#FNanchor_312" class="label">312</a>
For example the conclusion of the discourse of Aurelio, who,
it is true, describes rather than censures the dark side of human
society:&mdash;</p>
<p>
Todo esto se va en humo, hasta que tornan los hombres a estar
en tanto olvido, como antes que naciessen: i la misma vanidad se
sigue despues, que primero avia. Hasta aquí, Dinarco, me ha
parecido decir del hombre: agora yo lo dejo él i su fama enterrados
en olvido perdurable: i no sé con que razones tu, Antonio,
podrás resucitarlo. Dale vida, si pudieres, i consuelo contra tantos
males, como has oido: que si tu assi lo hicieres, yo seré vencido de
buena gana, pues tu vitoria será gloria para mi, que me veré constituido
en mas excelente estado, que pensava.</p></div>

The following passage from the treatise on the Spanish
language, forms an addition to the history of rhetorical cultivation
of prose rhetoric among the Spaniards in the age of Morales:&mdash;</p>
<p>
Para que pues era este cuidado? de que servia esta diligencia
entre gente tan prudente i de tanto miramiento, si naturaleza lo
suplia, i avia ella de hazerlo mejor? Veían sin duda, como sin tales
exemplos no se podia perfeccionar el uso della lengua en aquella
parte, i que a faltar lo que proveian, faltaria el bien que deseavan:
i lo mismo es en las formas i maneras particulares de hablar, que
llaman <i>phrasis</i>, i en todas las otras partes del lenguage, donde
ayudada naturaleza con el mejor uso, saca mas ventaja i perfeccion.
Pues qué los otros, que todo lo tienen en Castellano por afectado?
estos quieren condenar nuestra lengua a un estraño abatimiento, i
como enterrarla viva, donde miserablemente se corrompa i pierda
todo su lustre, su lindeza i hermosura: o desconfian, que no es para
parecer, i esta es ignorancia; o no la quieren adornar como deven,
i esta es maldad. <i>Yo no digo que afeites nuestra lengua Castellana,
sino que le laves la cara.</i> No le pintes el rostro, mas quitale
la suciedad: no la vistas de bordados, recamos, mas no le niegues
un buen atavio de vestido, que aderece con gravedad.</p></div>

As a useful moral book, this romance is, perhaps, worthy
of being translated or new modelled. Tasteless morality is, to be
sure, no more commendable in literature than tasteful immorality;
and any attempt to revive the fashion of moral allegories would
deserve condemnation. But a work like the allegorical romance of
Mexia, might probably possess more value than many of our modern
tales for youth.</p></div>

de Oliva’s eloquence:&mdash;</p>
<p>
Yo en contrario dello no dire de mi lastimas ningunas, porque
no lo acostumbro en tales casos. Pero si la cathedra de philosophia
moral supiesse hablar, que lastimas piensan vuestras mercedes
que diria? Ella por si diria, que miren quan olvidada ha estado,
y quan escureceda, muchas vezes por passiones de los que la han
proveydo, y que miren, que agora la demandan unos llorando, y
otros no se en que confiando; y que unos la quieren, para cumplir
sus necessidades, y otros para cumplir las agenas: no siendo aquesto
lo que ella ha menester. Porque ella demanda hombre, que en las
adversidades no gima, ni en los casos de justicia solicite.</p></div>

As Philip II. is but little known in the character of a letter

<p>
La verdad, i cumplimiento de lo que se dice, i promete, es el
fundamento del credito, i estimacion de los hombres, i sobre que
estriva, i se funda el trato comun, i confianza. Esto se requiere,
i es mucho mas necessario en los mui principales, i que tienen
grandes, i publicos cargos; porque de su verdad, i cumplimiento
depende la Fé, i seguridad publica. Encargoos mucho, que tengais
en esto gran cuenta, i cuidado; i se entienda, i conozca en Vos en
todas partes, i ocasiones, el credito, que pueden, i deven tener de
lo que digeredes: que demàs de lo que toca a las cosas publicas, i
de vuestro cargo, importa èsto mucho a vuestro particular honor i

Cervantes spent that portion of his life, during which his
name is particularly conspicuous, among Spanish poets, so remote
from literary society, that at his death sufficient notices did not
exist to form a complete narrative of his life. The well known
biography by Mayans y Siscar, which was not written till the
eighteenth century, deserved to be valued only for want of a better.
It is prefixed to many editions of Don Quixote. The preference,
however, must be given to the more recent life of Cervantes, by
Don Vicente de los Rios, which is prefixed to the splendid edition
of Don Quixote, published at Madrid, 1781, in royal quarto.</p></div>

Don Vicente de los Rios entertains so little doubt of the
reality of the romantic events, recorded in the Captive, that he has
interwoven them in his account of the life of Cervantes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_333" href="#FNanchor_333" class="label">333</a>
These dramas must not be confounded with the eight well
known comedies which Cervantes subsequently wrote. His tragedy
of Numantia, and his comedy of Life in Algiers, (<i>Trato de Argel</i>)
appear to have been written at an earlier period.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_334" href="#FNanchor_334" class="label">334</a>
For example, when Don Quixote speaks of the achievements
of the old knights, he always uses the antiquated expression:&mdash;Las
<i>fazañas</i> que han <i>fecho</i>, instead of <i>hazañas</i> que han
<i>hecho</i>.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_335" href="#FNanchor_335" class="label">335</a>
In the original Spanish, the term <i>insula</i> is uniformly
employed instead of the common word <i>isla</i>. Sancho probably
understood what an <i>isla</i> signified; but an <i>insula</i> was a word which
conveyed to his mind the idea of something magical and extraordinary.
He accordingly takes a great pleasure in emphatically
repeating it.</p></div>

As one specimen out of many, it will be sufficient to quote
the speech of the shepherdess Marcella. It is in the true prose
style of Cicero, and it is altogether a composition which has seldom
been equalled in any modern language:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hizome el Cielo, segun vosotros dezis, hermosa, y de tal manera,
que sin ser poderosos à otra cosa, à que me ameys os mueve mi
hermosura. Y por al amor que me mostràys, dezis, y aun quereys
que estè yo obligada à amaros. Yo conozco con el natural entendimiento,
que Dios me ha dado, que todo lo hermoso es amable, mas
no alcanço, que por razon de ser amado, esté obligado lo que es
amado por hermoso, à amar à quien le ama. Y mas que podria
acontecer, que el amador de lo hermoso fuèsse feo; y siendo lo feo
digno de ser aborrecido, càe muy mal el dezir: Quièrote por hermosa,
hasme de amar, aunque sea feo. Pero puesto caso que corran
igualmente las hermosuras, no por esso han de correr iguales los
desseos; que no todas las hermosùras enamòran, que algunas alegran
la vista, y no riuden la voluntad: que si todas las bellezas enamorassèn,
y rindiessèn: serià un andar las voluntades confusas, y
descaminadas, sin saber en qual avian de parar; porque siendo
infinitos los Sujetos hermosos, infinitos avian de ser los dessèos: y
segun yo he oydo dezir, el verdadero Amor no se divide, y ha de ser
voluntario, y no forçoso.</p></div>

These two dramas, the tragedy of Numancia and the comedy
of El Trato de Argel, were first printed in an appendix to the
new edition of the <i>Viage al Parnaso</i>, published at Madrid by Don
Antonio Sancha, in the year 1784.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_352" href="#FNanchor_352" class="label">352</a>
In the supplement to the <i>Viage al Parnaso</i>, Cervantes particularly
mentions his nine dramas in terms of the most decided
self-satisfaction. “If they were not my own, (he says) I should
declare that they merit all the praise they have obtained.” He
alludes with particular complacency to his comedy, entitled, <i>La
Confusa</i>, which he styles a <i>good one among the best</i>. But <i>La
Confusa</i>, as well as the others which Cervantes praises, is lost.
Among the eight which are known, <i>La Gran Sultana</i> seems to be
that which Cervantes mentions under the title of <i>La Gran Turquesca</i>.</p></div>

The biographer who wishes to compile in a perfect and
authentic way, the life of Lope de Vega, already so often related,
must not neglect the collection of elegies and epitaphs, which have
been lately printed, along with the hitherto scattered works of the
great Spanish dramatist, (<i>Obras Sueltas de Lope de Vega</i>;
Madrid, 1776, &amp;c. 21 vols. 4to.) Even Nicolas Antonio, whose
manner is so jejune, and who usually dismisses poets with very
little ceremony, bestows a long eulogium on Lope de Vega.</p></div>

Those who are unacquainted with the Spanish language, must
not suppose that the term <i>gracioso</i>, as applied to this kind of character,
is an extraordinary instance of that figure of speech called
euphemism. In Spanish, <i>gracioso</i> more frequently signifies comic
and ludicrous, than graceful.</p></div>

A list of the dramas contained in these twenty-five volumes
is given by Nicolas Antonio, who likewise communicates information
concerning Lope’s other works. A gleaning of some pieces
may be found in the <i>Obras Sueltas</i>; see note, p. 363. I have
never yet seen all the twenty-five volumes together. Even in Spain
a complete collection is but rarely to be met with. Single dramas
by Lope are to be found in most of the numerous collections of
Spanish comedies by various authors. La Huerta in his collection
has not included a single play of Lope de Vega, doubtless for
reasons which will hereafter be noticed.</p></div>

Notices concerning the various editions of the works of
Gongora, may be found in Dieze’s Remarks on Velasquez, p. 251.
A selection from the works of this unsuccessful genius, whose real
merit some critics have attempted to deny, was published by Don
Ramon Fernandez, under the title of <i>Poesias de D. Luis Gongora</i>,
Madrid 1787. The selection forms a small octavo volume.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_449" href="#FNanchor_449" class="label">449</a>
Dieze calls the <i>estilo culto</i> the Spanish ornamental style;
but this term is incorrect when employed to designate the particular
style of Gongora’s school.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_450" href="#FNanchor_450" class="label">450</a>
Among these illustrative works, are Salcedo Coronel’s diffuse
Commentaries on Gongora’s <i>Polyphemus y Soledades</i>, printed in
1629 and 1636; and also the <i>Lecciones solennes a las Obras de
Luis de Gongora</i>, by Joseph Pellicer de Salas, which appeared in
1630. See also Dieze’s Notes.</p></div>

Velasquez has occasioned no small degree of confusion in

to the principles of French criticism, confounds all the dramatic
writers of Spain in one class, and afterwards draws wide distinctions

by patriotic subscription, in a series of small folio volumes, under
the following title:&mdash;<i>Historia general de España, que escribiò el
P. Juan de Mariana, &amp;c.</i> Valencia, 1785.</p></div>

The subjoined extract, which affords a specimen of Mariana’s
historical style, is the commencement of his description of the
battle, which was lost by King Roderick in conflict with the Arabs,
and which was followed by the overthrow of the gothic monarchy:&mdash;</p>
<p>
El movido del peligro y daño, y encendido en deseo de tomar
emienda de lo pasado y de vengarse, apellidó todo el reyno. Mandó
que todos los que fuesen de edad, acudiesen á las banderas. Amenazó
con graves castigos á los que lo contrario hiciesen. Juntóse á
este llamamiento gran número de gente: los que menos cuentan, dicen
fueron pasados de cien mil combatientes. Pero con la larga paz,
como acontece, mostrábanse ellos alegres y bravos, blasonaban y
aun renegaban; mas eran cobardes á maravilla, sin esfuerzo y aun
sin fuerzas para sufrir los trabajos y incomodidades de la guerra.
La mayor parte iban desarmados, con hondas solamente ó bastones.
Este fue el exército con que el Rey marchó la vuelta del Andalucía.
Llegó por sus jornadas cerca de Xerez, donde el enemigo estaba
alojado. Asentó sus reales y fortificólos en un llano por la parte
que pasa el rio Guadalete. Los unos y los otros deseaban grandemente
venir á las manos; los Moros orgullosos con la victoria; los
Godos por vengarse, por su patria, hijos, mugeres y libertad no
dudaban poner á riesgo las vidas, sin embargo que gran parte
dellos sentian en sus corazones una tristeza extraordinaria, y un
silencio qual suele caer á las veces como presagio del mal que ha
de venir sobre algunos. <i>Lib.</i> vi. <i>cap.</i> 23.</p></div>

The surname Villegas has given rise to many blunders respecting
Quevedo and the celebrated Estèban Manuel de Villegas.

These canciones and romances are contained in the great
collection of the poems of Quevedo, published by the Gongorist
Gonzales de Salas, under the Gongoristic title of <i>El Parnaso
Español, Monte en dos cumbres dividido</i>, (that is to say, in two
volumes.) A new, but very far from elegant, edition of this collection
of Quevedo’s poems appeared at Madrid, in 1729, in quarto. It
is divided into books, each of which bears the name of one of the
muses.</p></div>

Quevedo’s <i>Sueños</i>, or Visions, which are now translated
into almost every cultivated language in Europe, were shortly after
their appearance, introduced into German literature by Moscherosch

The Duke of Veragua’s letter, together with Calderon’s
answer, and the catalogue to which the correspondence bears reference,
are printed in La Huerta’s <i>Teatro Hespañol</i>, vol. iii.

Satisfactory accounts of the various collections and editions
of the dramas, and other less important works of Calderon, are
contained in Dieze’s Remarks on Velasquez, p. 242 and p. 341.
The dramas of Calderon, which La Huerta has published in his
<i>Teatro Hespañol</i>, afford but a partial idea of the poet’s talent; for
those he has selected are all <i>Comedias de Capa y Espada</i>, two only
excepted; and of these two, one, which is styled a <i>Comedia heroyca</i>,
belongs to the mythological class.</p></div>

According to the testimony of travellers, even the most
unlettered Spaniard is so accustomed to follow without effort a
complicated dramatic plot, that after witnessing the representation
of a piece, he will describe all the minute details of the romantic
story, while a well informed foreigner, familiar with the Spanish
language, can with difficulty comprehend a few of the scenes.</p></div>

A very superficial criticism on Calderon’s dramatic works,
written by Blas Nasarre, who was prepossessed in favour of French
literature, is contained in the History of Spanish Poetry, by Velasquez.

Narracion. Con este conocimiento he puesto en la certidumbre de
lo que refiero, mi principal cuydado. Examen, que algunas vezes
me bolviò à la tarea de los Libros, y Papeles: porque hallando en
los Sucessos, ò en sus circunstancias, discordantes, con notable
oposicion, à nuestros mismos Escritores, me ha sido necessario
buscar la Verdad con poca luz, ò congeturarla de lo mas verisimil;
pero digo entonces mi reparo: y si llego á formar opinion, conozco

Que? Que sientes mucho el hazerte heredero de tu abuelo el mar,
en la inconstancia, y engaños? No por cierto, que essas son niñerias;
pues si estas son burlas, que seràn las veras? Lo que à mi me irrita,
es, que me levanten testimonies. Aguarda, que ya te entiendo, sin
duda es aquello que dizen, que trocaste el arco con la muerte, y que
desde entonces no te llaman ya amor de amar, sino de morir, amor
á muerte; de modo, que amor, y muerte todo es uno. <i>Crisi</i> iv.</p></div>

He reduces all mental talents and faculties to two kinds, <i>Genio</i>
and <i>Ingenio</i>. But the distinctions he draws between them, are as difficult
to translate as the different applications of the French word
<i>Esprit</i>. On this subject he says, among other things:&mdash;</p>

<p>Estos dos son <i>los dos Exes del lucimiento discreto</i>, la naturaleza
los alterna, y el arte los realça. Es el hombre aquel celebre
Microcosmos, y el Alma su firmamento. Hermanados el Genio, y
el Ingenio, en verificacion de Athlante, y de Alcides; asseguran el
brillar, por lo dichoso, y lo lucido, á todo el resto de prendas.</p>

otros, ni perciben, ni se mueven. Oy todo les sale bien, mañana
todo mal, que aun el entendimiento, y la ventura tienen desiguales.
Donde no ay disculpa, es en la voluntad, que es crimen del alvedrio,
y su variar no està lexos del desvariar. Lo que oy ponen sobre su
cabeça, mañana lo llevan entre pies, por no tener pies, ni cabeça.</p></div>

Thus, he says, Homer intended his Iliad, as a book of moral
and political instruction, suited to the most vulgar understanding:&mdash;</p>

<p>Con este intento escribiò <i>Homero</i> sus Poemas, explicando en
ellos <i>à los entendimientos mas bassos</i> las verdades de <i>la Moral</i>, de
<i>la Politica</i>, y tambien (como muchos sientan) de la Philosophia
natural, y de la Theologia. Pues en la Iliada debaxo de la Imagen
de la Guerra Troyana, y de las disensiones de los Capitanes Griegos,
propuso à la Grecia entonces dividida en vandos <i>un exemplo en que
aprendiesse</i> à apaciguar sus discordias, conociendo quan graves
daños causaban al publico, y quan necessaria para el sucesso en las

Poetas. Fuè creciendo este desorden sin que nadie intentasse oponersele.
Los ignorantes, no teniendo quien les abriesse los ojos, seguian

Velasquèz, under the conviction that nothing could be more
correct and striking than Luzan’s judgment on the Spanish drama,
has quoted his opinions at length, and incorporated them in his
History of Spanish Poetry.</p></div>

The two opening stanzas of this poem, will afford a sufficient
specimen of the poetic diction of the ingenious author:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">para henchir tanta vela faltó el viento.<br /></span>

The following three stanzas from this poem will serve to shew
the manner in which Luzan combined his poetic subject with the
peculiarities requisite in a poem written on a particular occasion:&mdash;</p>

See Dieze on Velasquez p. 265. Lessing has made the
Germans acquainted with Montiano’s Virginia. Though Lessing
knew little of Spanish dramatic literature, even at second hand, he
at that time took an interest in every tragic Virginia, because he
was engaged in a Virginia of his own, which he ultimately converted
into his Emilia Galotti.</p></div>

This collection which has been so frequently alluded to in
the course of the present work, is entitled:&mdash;<i>Theatro Hespañol,
por Don Vicente Garcia de la Huerta</i>, Madrid, 1785, sq. in 16
volumes, small octavo. The 16th volume, which contains some critical
notices in the form of an appendix, was published very lately.
The 15th volume, which bears the title of <i>Suplemento</i>, comprises
the tragic dramas of La Huerta himself; and the 14th volume presents
a choice selection of burlesque interludes. The work also contains
an alphabetic list of most of the dramas in the Spanish language,
which is extremely useful. The title is characteristic from the
substitution of the word <i>Hespañol</i> for <i>Español</i>, according to its
derivation from <i>Hispanus</i>.</p></div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
